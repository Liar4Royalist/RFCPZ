                               RENEWED RADICALISM, 1973-74 


Prelude, September 1973-January 1974 

       The theoretical/ideological justifications for a renewal of the radicalism of 
the Cultural Revolution were provided in part by the reappearance in 1973 of an 
argument first put forward by Chen Boda in 1968 (see chapter three). One of Mao's 
major obsessions, and one that he had incessantly harangued his senior colleagues 
about since 1962, was his notion that socialist society consisted of classes and that 
the major contradiction in the era of socialism was that between the proletariat 
and the bourgeoisie. Chen Boda had argued in 1968, basing himself on Mao's 
statement that the communist party inevitably contained factions, that factions 
represented classes. The proletarian faction represented the proletariat and the 
bourgeoisie had its own representatives -- the bourgeois faction or revisionists. 
This argument laid the groundwork for the position adopted by Zhang Chunqiao 
 and Yao Wenyuan in articles that they published in 1975 that the bourgeoisie itself 

 was entrenched within the body of the CCP. 
       In September 1973, Hongqi carried an article by the party branch of a 
 production brigade in a Beijing county repeating Maos 1966 statement concerning 
 the presence of factions within the party.1 On this occasion the quotation was used 
 to condemn factionalism. The radical journal from Shanghai Study and Criticism 
         jEj ^ll), hi 311 article °f May 1974 also cited Mao, without 
 attribution, and stated that "those who represent different class interests [are] 
 bound to form different factions and organize different parties". It continued: 

        The appearance of different political factions and the struggle between 
        the two lines in our Party are a reflection in the Party of the class 
        struggle in society, and chieftains of opportunist lines are agents of the 
        landlords and bourgeoisie who wormed their way into the party of the 
        proletariat.2 

 The radicals used such arguments to justify their renewed attacks on their 
 opponents within the party. Recourse to the vague, semi-formulated ideas of Mao 

 Zedong was their starting point. 
132 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

     A series of radically-inspired articles appeared in the period around the 
convocation of the CCP 10th Congress. The subjects covered included the plight of 
rusticated youth, the unfairness of university entrance examinations and the new 
"revisionist education line". On 16 August 1973, an article which was to have 
wide repercussions over the next twelve months appeared in the People's Daily.3 
It called on Chinese youth to emulate Zhang Tiesheng, the rusticated youth who 
had submitted a blank examination paper, and "go against the tide" 
Its impact across the country was somewhat similar to that of Mao's big-character 
poster of August 1966 calling on the young to rebel against reactionaries. In order 
 to reinforce the message, the People's Daily published articles on 18 August 
 commemorating the 7th anniversary of Mao's first reception of Red Guards in the 
 Cultural Revolution. Attacks on industrial rules and regulations published the 
 following day suggested a co-ordinated and concerted effort to drum up the 
 atmosphere for a revival of mass radicalism.4 According to China News 
 Summary,5 Henan and Zhejiang were the only two provinces to express 
 immediate support for the leftist initiatives. Perhaps the Zhejiang government 
 office in Shanghai had alerted the Zhejiang authorities to the strategic importance 
 of these articles emanating from Beijing. 
      In a political atmosphere reminiscent of mid-1966, the CCP National 
 Congress opened amidst great secrecy on 24 August 1973.6 In his report on the 
 revision of the CCP statutes, Wang Hongwen praised the trend of "going against 
 the tide" and the publicized confessions by individuals who had obtained 
 privileged treatment or favors by "going through the back door" (jfeJa HP as 
 manifestations of a revolutionary spirit. He also announced that Mao's Cultural 
 Revolution cadre policy of combining the old, the middle-aged and the young 
                  would be written into the party statutes.7 Flushed with 
 success by their gains in the appointments to the new CC and Politburo, the 
 radicals stepped up the pressure on Zhou Enlai. 
      One delegate who would have savored the tenor of these remarks was Weng 
 Senhe. The clause regarding cadres would later provide Weng and his colleagues 
 with the ideological justification for their strategy of inducting fellow rebels into 
 the party and promoting them as cadres. Weng's presence as a member of the 
 Zhejiang delegation had caused controversy among his fellow workers at the silk 
 complex.8 Zhang Chunqiao and Wang Hongwen were reportedly determined to 
 secure Weng's selection and they exerted pressure on Tan Qilong to this end. It 
 was later claimed that in December 1972 Zhang had told the ZPC leaders that 
 Weng Senhe "was the first among the workers throughout the country who rose 
 and rebelled during the great cultural revolution and that one should come to see 
 his history!" In the summer of 1973 Wang Hongwen told Tan Qilong that in 
 electing workers to the Zhejiang delegation for the 10th Congress "It's necessary to 
                                                        RENEWED RADICALISM 133 

take history into consideration; even if it is somewhat difficult, we must strive 
our hardest for his [Weng's] election".9 
      Even before the commencement of the Congress the Zhejiang rebels were 
 making preparations to launch their attack on the provincial leadership of Tan 
 Qilong and Tie Ying. In July 1973 Zhang Yongsheng commissioned Wang Jiashu, 
 a staff member in the Hangzhou Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team office, 
 to gather evidence from the provincial and municipal party offices and draft a 
 document denouncing Tan and Tie for negating the Cultural Revolution. In 
 September Zhang lobbied members and alternate members of the ZPC to sign the 
 document which charged the provincial leadership with suppressing the 
 innovative forces j|) and propping up the old-timers (^p |0

       To coincide with the opening of the Party Congress in Beijing and before the 
 public appearance of the open letter to Tie and Tan, a poster was pasted up in the 
 courtyard of the CCP HMC offices in downtown Hangzhou. It was signed by a 
 group of "new office-worker cadres" and criticized both the provincial and 
 municipal authorities. The thrust of the complaint was that in the campaign 
 against Lin Biao and his followers in 1972-73 the signatories had been "swept back 
 to camp" that is, to the factories and colleges from whence they 
 had been promoted. They demanded reinstatement and assembled in the building 
 occupied by the municipal workers' congress to form a study class. To press their 
 complaints further the group reportedly moved into municipal party offices, 
 forcibly occupied the meeting room of the party standing committee and seized 
 documents. They believed that these actions would force the authorities to 
 respond to their gripes. The Hangzhou workers’ congress took up the cause and 
 convened a meeting of its leadership at the New China Theater in the center of 
 Hangzhou. It decided to organize a Beijing-bound complaints delegation (j£h 
  IB 0 or Jiijj ffl of disgruntled cadres.11 
       In October-November "complaints delegations" assembled in Hangzhou 
 from various counties across the province. They participated in a series of 
  meetings held at the ZPRC hostel in Mishi Lane just off Moganshan 
  Rd in the north-west of the city, and at the ZPC retreat on Mt. Pingfeng. Over forty 
  counties had sent delegations and twenty of the delegations comprised a total of 
  200 to 300 members. The original plan was to send the 300 delegates to the 
  national capital, but the word from Beijing was that such a large number would be 
  undesirable and that it would be preferable if Zhang, Weng and He did not 
  personally lead the delegation. It was decided instead that Li Xiantong (Zhang's 
  colleague in United Headquarters and a former student at Hangzhou University) 
  and Wang Jiashu would lead seventeen complainants on the mission.12 
       Wang Hongwen soon became involved in the affairs of the province once 
134 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

more. On 10 August, Zhang, Weng and He had sent him material with a covering 
letter informing him of developments in Zhejiang since his visit of January 
1973.13 On 4 October Wang, now Vice-chairman of the CCP CC, telephoned Zhang 
Yongsheng and encouraged him to launch an attack on the leaders of the ZPC and 
prepare for a lengthy battle. Wang informed Zhang that "several problems have 
emerged in Zhejiang". Zhang sprang into action and assembled his supporters. 
They formulated a document entitled "Report on the situation in learning from 
Shanghai in selecting and training successors for the proletarian revolutionary 
cause" ±'M rff ft 4ft Jg # % /* M 
Sr Iil£ The document warned that "activists of the 
counter-revolutionary ’May 16’ clique" should be "cleared out and investigated". 
It specified that the criteria for selection to the "proletarian revolutionary cause" 
would be previous experience in line struggles and whether an individual had 
 rebelled "early or later" in the Cultural Revolution.14 
      The selection of loyalists on the basis of when they had joined the Cultural 
 Revolution to some extent cut across the Red Storm/United Headquarters 
 division. Both Zhang Yongsheng and Weng Senhe had been amongst the earliest 
 rebels in Zhejiang, although initially their unit-based groups had joined opposing 
 umbrella mass organizations. Perhaps Zhang and Weng were trying to heal the 
 divisions among Cultural Revolution activists dating from 1967 with the 
 objective of recruiting and remobilizing rebels from both sides, in particular those 
 who had survived the witch-hunt against "May 16" rebels in the years 1969-71. In 
 this endeavor they may have been partly successful. 
      The same day as Wang Hongwen had telephoned Zhang a big-character 
 poster, in the form of an open letter from Zhang, Weng and He to Tan and Tie, 
 appeared on the streets of Hangzhou.15 At a meeting of ten or so rebels early in 
 September, some of those in attendance had expressed reservations about putting 
 up a poster in the streets. They recommended that the letter be posted inside 
 government offices. Weng brushed aside their worries in typically brusque 
 fashion but in the end it was undoubtedly Wang Hongwen’s encouragement 
 which gave the rebels the courage to proceed.16 They coined a sixteen-character 
 guiding slogan which read: "grasp the initiative, struggle on the spot, spread our 
 influence and open up prospects".17 
      On 25 October Zhang Yongsheng, Li Xiantong and Yan Yihuan (a leader of 
 the "complaints' delegation" from Zhejiang University) signed a big-character 
 poster refusing to join the study class organized by the provincial leaders to study 
 the documents of the 10th National Congress.18 In a speech of 20 November 
 Zhang argued that Wang's telephone directives of 4 October should form the basis 
 for studying the documents.19 With the political pressure on the provincial 
 leadership building up in Hangzhou, Wang Hongwen applied more from Beijing. 
                                                        RENEWED RADICALISM 135 

On 16 November he telephoned Tan Qilong and instructed him to dissuade the 
"complaints delegation" from leaving Hangzhou.20 Wang also asked Tan to make 
a self-criticism on behalf of the provincial party committee for the "excesses" 
committed against the former leaders of United Headquarters over the previous 
eighteen months. Wang also requested Tan to support the principle of "going 
against the tide". Tan, Tie and other members of the standing committee 
reportedly agreed not to act on Wang's instructions and decided not to relay 
Wang's suggestion that Tan make a self-criticism. That the Zhejiang party leaders 
refused outright is highly unlikely given Wang's status as Mao's newly-anointed 
successor.21 They may have fudged, procrastinated or prevaricated in the hope 
 that countervailing orders would be issued. 
      Nevertheless, news of Wang's instructions soon reached Zhang Yongsheng, 
 having been leaked by a member of the standing committee of the municipal 
 party committee. A senior member of Tan's executive, Lai Keke, undermined 
 Tan's stand by writing a report to Wang Hongwen expressing sympathy for the 
 "fighters going against the tide" and lashing his senior colleagues for their 
 political outlook and performance. Lai sent Wang a second report on 9 December 
 1973, distancing himself from the provincial leadership and extolling the youthful 
 Vice-chairman.22 The divulgence of personal communications between party 
 leaders in order to score political points soon became a common occurrence in 
 Zhejiang. Factional loyalties superseded party discipline with enormous 
 consequences for Tan's leadership in the province. Wall posters appeared on the 
 streets accusing Tan of trying to change and conceal "Vice-chairman Wang's 
 directives". 
       Shortly thereafter, possibly at Wang's behest the 300-strong counties 
 delegation led by Zhang, Weng and He, rebelled (£X|) against the provincial 
 leadership. Holding banners they marched to Huagang reception center, 
 situated on the western side of the West Lake, where the provincial leadership 
 was meeting. They then gathered on Mt. Pingfeng to plan their next move.23 
 With Wang Hongwen's approval, they summoned Tan and other provincial 
 leaders to the mountain for questioning, and defiantly asserted an equal status 
 with the party leadership (-fr HUt^TL^U- 
       For four and a half days at the end of November 1973, Tan and his colleagues 
 were forcefully interrogated ($4).24 The rebels’ objective was to force them to 
 agree to placing more young cadres in leading groups. First of all they sought the 
 rehabilitation of rebels who had come under fire in the political campaign of 1972- 
 73, as the "suggestion" paper drawn up by the rebels on 8 December 1973 
 revealed.25 Tie Ying came under further attack at the end of December (or early 
 January 1974)26 when he was detained for another three to four days at the Mishi 
 Lane hostel.27 The rebels again raised critical opinions regarding the shortcomings 
136 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

in the work of the provincial leadership. The occupation ($ of Mt 
Pingfeng and the detention of provincial leaders were flagrant acts of rebellion 
against the provincial leadership which seriously weakened its authority. Tan 
Qilong and Tie Ying had been humiliated before their peers and defied and treated 
with contempt by their youthful protagonists.

                                                                 RENEWED RADICALISM 137 

       Zhang Yongsheng aimed to "haul out restorationist forces" among the 
Zhejiang leadership and to discover which party leaders were prepared to desert 
Tan. He found two in Lai Keke and Chai Qikun, who were ready to join forces 
with him28 as was Wang Zida, First Secretary of the CCP HMC and a standing 
committee member of the CCP ZPC. Wang wrote to the provincial party 
committee demanding that Tan and Tie "make lofty self-criticisms" and added 
 that "this is the key question at the present time".29 One specific charge levelled 
 against Tan related to remarks he had made in June 1972 during his inspection 
 tour with Tie Ying of Fuyang county, adjacent to Hangzhou. On his drive through 
 the countryside. Tan had commented on the slow pace of development since his 
 previous visit back in 1954. His words were: 

        the tea-bushes on both sides of the road are thinly scattered and the 
        ground is not even; I've been away from here for eighteen years and 
        there hasn't been much of a change. 

 Tan's remarks were circulated throughout Zhejiang as evidence of his negative 
 attitude toward the Cultural Revolution.30 
        The principal and overriding issue for the rebels was, however, power. Weng 
 Senhe stated bluntly at a meeting in March 1974 that "It’s already been seven to 
 eight years of the Cultural Revolution, and recently what have we got 
 organizationally?... We must get leadership power!"31 Weng later confessed in 

 prison: 

        I saw a speech by Zhang Chunqiao. He said: "the rebels must not only 
        destroy but also hold on to power". When I read this I felt as good as if I 
        had just eaten an icy-pole on a summer's day and felt grateful that 
        Zhang Chunqiao really understood and felt for us (fit'll A)-32 

 He Xianchun agreed. He threatened that "we won’t leave the mountain until 
 we’ve solved this personnel problem". Zhang Yongsheng reminded his fellow 
 rebels of the suffering that they had endured in 1972 because too few of them had 
 joined the CCP and said that this lesson should never be forgotten.33 
        As earlier chapters of this study have detailed, the rebel leaders had formed a 
  close association in the old United Headquarters mass organization. Their 
  factional enemies, who included former activists from Red Storm, tended to 
  support the provincial leadership. However, the two groups which emerged in 
  1974, while having their origins in the divisions of 1966-69, were formed 
  specifically in relation to the Mt. Pingfeng rebellion. One became known as the 
  "mountain top" faction (lh±W the other the "mountain base" faction 

  (lilT lli?)-34 zhang' Weng and He led the the ”mountain toP" faction- Guo 
  Zhisong and Fang Jianwen, both vice-chairmen of the ZPTUC who had been on 
  opposing sides in the 1960s, led the latter faction. Other Cultural Revolution 
138 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

activists may have remained non-committed. The political fall-out from the 
occupation of Mt. Pingfeng soon spread across the whole province and this 
sensational incident helped trigger off a series of events which eventually forced 
Zhejiang before the attention of the whole country in July 1975. 
      To destabilize further the political environment in Zhejiang, Zhang 
Yongsheng and Weng Senhe managed to secure the release from prison of 
convicted criminals whom they then enlisted into the para-military forces that 
they were building in the factories of Hangzhou. In August 1973 two workers from 
Weng’s silk mill who had been involved in a vicious assault on six female fellow- 
workers in 1967 were scheduled to be tried a third time. For five days in mid- 
August Weng's supporters held demonstrations and sit-ins at the offices of the 
municipal party and government authorities and disrupted court proceedings. 
When the verdict was announced in October and one offender was released, 
having already served out his sentence, he was compensated with six years' back 
pay. In celebrations held at the silk complex he was hailed as a returning hero.35 
The reopening of old wounds further accentuated cleavages among the mill's 
work-force. 
      After the success of their revolt on Mt. Pingfeng, the rebel trio visited 
 factories in Hangzhou to gather support and measure their opponents’ strength. 
 In December 1973 Weng visited the Red Flag Paper Mill and called on workers not 
 to work for the "wrong political line". Those who did he denigrated as "lambs".36 
 On 17 December the three militant leaders appeared at the Hangzhou Iron and 
 Steel Mill. This factory was an obvious target for the rebels because of the publicity 
 which had surrounded it earlier in the year (see chapter six). In his report to the 
 workers Weng derided the mill's production results, comparing them 
 unfavorably with iron and steel output in the United States and Japan. He argued 
 that the correctness of the political line was more important than output; if the 
 line was wrong the workers were just creating wealth for capitalist restoration.37 
 The presence of the three rebel leaders apparently provoked strong resistance from 
 workers of an opposing faction who unceremoniously showed them the factory 
 gates. Nevertheless, Weng did recruit workers to his faction at this factory.38 The 
 Hangzhou Gearbox Works (^ft, jt| ^ /"*) in Xiaoshan made it clear that 
 Weng was not welcome by warning him that it could not guarantee his personal 
 safety, thereby ensuring that Weng did not appear at all 39 Weng and his 
 colleagues also visited factories in other areas of the province and called for the 
 overthrow of Tan Qilong.40 
      To maintain the momentum of this aggressive approach, in January 1974 the 
 HMWC convened a rally in Hangzhou's Exhibition Square. The square is situated 
 at the northern end of Yanan Road, one of the city's main thoroughfares. The 
 rally was held to celebrate the seventh anniversary of Shanghai's "January storm".

The former rebel leaders of United Headquarters mounted the rostrum once again 
and were joined by sympathizers from the provincial and municipal party 
committees. Following the speeches a parade, which turned into a demonstration 
against the provincial leadership, took place. Beijing had sent a telegram ordering 
the organizers to desist and the local authorities had pleaded with them to call off 
the day's activities. Zhang Yongsheng was not swayed by the approach and 
threatened to lead his followers to sit down on the railway tracks at the Hangzhou 
station if the provincial authorities tried to ban the rally.41 

The Campaign against Lin Biao and Confucius: Opening Shots 

      Although the opening of the 10th National Congress had been accompanied 
by a series of press reports designed to initiate a further radicalization of national 
politics, the campaign against Lin Biao and Confucius did not 
get underway until January 1974. It was Mao whose intervention once again 
proved decisive. At the end of 1973 a meeting of the Politburo was held to discuss 
 the important issue of transferring commanders of military regions. A series of 
 direct exchanges and new appointments were carried out involving eight of the 
eleven commanders.42 As a result of the transfer the military commanders lost 
 their additional posts as provincial first party secretaries, thus loosening the grip 
 of regional military leaders over local party committees and lowering the PLA’s 
 representation among the twenty-nine provincial-level first secretaries. The 
 decision had the additional benefit of removing regional commanders, such as 
 Nanjing's commander Xu Shiyou, who had become entrenched in their 
 bailiwicks. The order to carry out the transfer was issued on 22 December 43 
       At the same Politburo meeting Mao also voiced his displeasure with the 
 work of the body as well as with that of the CC MAC. He stated vaguely but 
 ominously that the "Politburo doesn't discuss politics and the military 
 commission doesn't discuss military or political affairs .Pj'f'3^ 
                              These comments were directed at Zhou 
 Enlai and Marshall Ye Jianying who were in charge of the routine work of the 
 respective bodies. The Chairman warned his colleagues to prepare for both civil 
 and external war, the outbreak of which would clarify who was willing to fight, 
 who would collaborate with foreigners and who wished to become emperor. He 
 also proposed the addition of Deng Xiaoping to both the Politburo and the Military 
 Affairs Commission because, in Mao's words, he "handles affairs in a relatively 
 decisive manner" and "is firm but gentle, like a needle in cotton" 
 ^SFtBf)-44 
       The transfer of regional commanders was to have important consequences 
 for Zhejiang. A circular of the CCP ZPC and ZPRC dated 17 December 1973 
 indicated that an important decision was about to be made. The circular requested 
140 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

all PLA units in Zhejiang "on their own initiative [sic] to ask local Party 
committees for instructions and report to them on their work and consciously 
accept the centralised leadership of the party".45 As a result of Mao s decision, 
importantly. Tan Qilong, Tie Ying and Xia Qi lost the substantial backing of Xu 
Shiyou, who was transferred to Guangzhou, and in his place arrived Ding Sheng, 
a PLA leader more sympathetic to the radical cause. It is unclear, however, what 
influence Ding exerted in Nanjing because of the cloud which remained over his 
head due to his past association with the Lin Biao group. It has been alleged that 
shortly after his arrival in Nanjing, Beijing ordered him to stand aside and 
undergo investigation for his activities in Guangzhou.45 Xu s departure in effect 
gave the Nanjing region’s First Political Commissar Zhang Chunqiao, who in 
February 1974 was appointed Director of the PLA General Political Department, 
much more influence in military affairs in the region.47 This development was 
undoubtedly a blessing for the rebel leaders in Zhejiang. 
       At a meeting with members of the MAC on 21 December Mao issued another 
cryptic warning about the emergence of revisionism (#□ H ^ [U t±l 7 
                                     Mao had issued such warnings 
before in September 1965 and again at the end of 1966, with dire consequences. The 
Chairman indirectly raised the question of capitulationism by referring to the 
classic novel Water Margin in which the bandits "didn't oppose the emperor, only 
corrupt officials, and later accepted an amnesty and returned to the service of the 
emperor". In the talk Mao also accepted responsibility for the wrongful dismissal 
of senior military leaders during the years 1965-68, dismissals which, he claimed 
had been recommended by Lin Biao.48 Mao thereby paved the way for their 
 rehabilitation (posthumous in the case of He Long) and simultaneously moved to 
 placate the PLA in the aftermath of the transfer of regional commanders. Lin 
 Biao's military reputation and his place in the pantheon of communist military 
 heroes was severely undermined by articles published later in 1974, presumably a 
 move designed to restore something approaching accuracy to the historical record 
 and to reinstate the contributions of military leaders who had been incorrectly 
 downgraded.49 A central document of 22 December advised the party of Deng's 
 addition to the Politburo and the MAC.50 Premier Zhou Enlai was thus provided 
 with a senior experienced administrator to assist him in running party and 
 government affairs. A routine medical examination in May 1972 had discovered 
 that Zhou had contracted cancer and in June 1974 he was admitted to hospital for a 
 series of operations and treatment.51 Deng's promotion guaranteed that the 
 succession to Mao and Zhou would not fall automatically into the hands of the 
 Cultural Revolution radicals. 

        Deng Xiaoping's principal protagonist in the upper echelons of the CCP was 
 the much younger and inexperienced Wang Hongwen. The anti-Lin Biao anti- 
                                                        RENEWED RADICALISM 141 

Confucius campaign, which commenced in 1974, was to provide Wang Hongwen 
with his first test as a senior national leader. It was Wang who conveyed Mao's 
remarks concerning the possible emergence of revisionism in a speech to senior 
cadres on 29 December.52 Then, in a speech to the central study class on 14 January 
 1974 Wang vigorously defended the Cultural Revolution.53 He admitted that 
 controversy still surrounded it. Some people believed the Cultural Revolution 
 had been "necessary and timely" while others viewed it like a "dark night", a 
 "ravaging flood and a savage beast", "thunder in the clear sky of an early 
 morning", and even "a great misunderstanding, very reactionary in nature". 
 Those who held the latter view, stated Wang, opposed progress, desired 
 restoration and planned to take revenge for the sufferings they had experienced. 
 Others, while supporting the Cultural Revolution in principle, opposed the way 
 in which it had been carried out. They frowned on the "four greats" — speaking 
 out freely, airing views fully, holding great debates, and writing wall posters. 
 Wang argued that to oppose the Cultural Revolution was to attempt to restore 
 capitalism and practise revisionism. He advocated the slogan of "going against the 
 tide" to rekindle the spirit of rebellion. 
       In his speech Wang touched on two other important themes -- discipline in 
 the PLA and the status of young cadres. He claimed that obedience to orders was 
 conditional on their conformity to Marxism-Leninism Mao Zedong Thought. 
 Soldiers should rebel against orders contradicting these principles. But as Wang 
 reduced the essence of Marxism to the maxim "to rebel is justified", the 
 permissible scope for disobedience seemed alarmingly broad. Concerning the 
 question of young cadres who had been promoted during the Cultural 
 Revolution, Wang defended them and advocated the appointment of young 
 officers to senior military commands. Otherwise, he opined, the "traitors, enemy 
 agents and capitalist-roaders will return and the new-born things of the Cultural 
 Revolution will be abolished”. According to Wang rumors had been circulating, 
 concerning veteran and younger cadres which went: "old marshalls must return 
 to their posts; little soldiers must go back to their barracks". Mao had changed this 
 couplet to read: "old marshalls return to the line; little soldiers are promoted . 
       Wang's resolute defence of the Cultural Revolution heralded the 
 commencement of the campaign in the same month.54 Two CC documents which 
 were distributed in mid-January contained a list of recommended references for 
 study and tried to link the thoughts of Lin Biao with the classical analects of 
 Confucius.55 The document of 18 January was published six days after a written 
  request to the Chairman by Wang Hongwen and Jiang Qing.56 The first mass 
  rallies occurred in Beijing on 24 and 25 January and involved troops of the Beijing 
  units and bureaucrats in central departments. Jiang Qing, Yao Wenyuan and two 
  close associates of Jiang’s at Qinghua University, Chi Qun57 and Xie Jingyi, 
142 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

delivered speeches. Premier Zhou Enlai attended and was forced to make a self- 
criticism.58 
      Jiang Qing further involved herself in the campaign by establishing a model 
unit in the PLA. Jiang Qing’s first move, and one that was to have serious 
consequences for the leadership in Zhejiang, was to send Chi Qun and Xie Jingyi 
as her personal emissaries to the anti-chemical warfare company of 
the 20th Army. Stationed at Huzhou, a city situated north of Hangzhou,59 the 
company came under the command of the 20th Army (Unit 6409). Chi and Xie 
delivered a letter from Jiang as well as 200 copies of the booklet compiled at 
Beijing and Qinghua Universities and used as prescribed reading in the campaign. 
      The Beijing envoys arrived in Huzhou on 15 January and returned to the 
capital a week later to report back to Jiang. Jiang Qing allegedly saw off her envoys 
with the following words: "I am fond of firing canon shots. I am a gunner; I 
manufacture canons and canon balls and I have some artillery batteries. Now I am 
shooting you out as canon balls; you are going to open fire".60 Her emissaries 
brought back letters from the anti-chemical warfare company and the party 
committees of the 20th Army and the Nanjing Military Region. The letters 
expressed thanks to Jiang for her concern and pledged their determination to live 
up to her expectations and were released as a CC document on 25 January 1974. 
The anti-chemical warfare company subsequently received extensive coverage in 
the national and the Zhejiang press and certain of its members became prominent 
speakers at meetings and rallies which were held in the province.61 The model 
was therefore one to which the leaders of Zhejiang had to pay more than lip- 
service, whether they supported it or not. The fact that the company also became a 
model for the "crash-admission" of party members and "crash-promotion" of 
cadres did not help endear it to the provincial party leadership.62 Nevertheless, it 
was awkward having a "model" in one's own backyard. The further away a model 
was, the greater the likelihood that the center would accept the plea for exemption 
or adaptation on the grounds that it did not conform to local conditions. 
      As the leadership in Zhejiang prepared to launch the campaign in the 
province it faced daunting prospects. The "mountain top" faction had already 
responded to the calls by radical central leaders to "go against the tide", promote 
new cadres and defy politically unacceptable orders. Additionally, workers were 
enjoined, in a big-character poster originating from Shanghai dockers and 
published in the People's Daily on 1 February 1974, to become masters of their 
enterprises and not "slaves to tonnage". Enterprise directors were subsequently 
 hesitant to exercise leadership in the workplace, an abrogation of responsibility 
 that would have dire consequences in Zhejiang.63 Wang Hongwen had already 
 personally intervened to spur on the rebels and Jiang Qing had established a 
 model military unit in the province for the campaign. The "mountain top" 
                                                        RENEWED RADICALISM 143 

faction possessed a solid organizational base in the Hangzhou workers' congress 
and some influence in the provincial trade union council. They had highly-placed 
allies in the Hangzhou party committee and with the assistance of sympathetic 
provincial leading cadres could apply pressure to and isolate Tan and Tie in the 
CCP ZPC. In order to confront the provincial authorities and especially the 
military more effectively, the rebels required an armed force and this they were 
 about to create in the form of the Hangzhou Municipal Militia Command 
 Headquarters. 

 The Anti-Lin Anti-Confucius Campaign in Zhejiang, 1974 

      The following analysis of the anti-Lin anti-Confucius campaign in Zhejiang 
 examines both its public and less visible aspects, an approach that in places 
 interrupts the chronological flow for the sake of thematic unity. Developments 
 that occurred behind the scenes greatly influenced the campaign as did trends and 
 directives emanating from Beijing. Shortly after the campaign began in February 
 1974, until mid-year when the CC issued a document reining in the movement, 
 leaders of the "mountain top" faction virtually seized power in the province 
 through their control over the conduct of the campaign. In the second half of the 
 year Tan Qilong, with the backing of the central authorities, shifted the focus of 
 attention onto the ailing economy. Despite a few final passing shots from the 
 rebels, the campaign was brought to a conclusion in November, although by 
 August the peak of its intensity had passed. 
       At the opening rally of the campaign in Hangzhou on 2 February 1974 there 
 was no outward indication of the dramatic and turbulent events which were 
 about to occur.64 Tan Qilong presided, Chen Weida and Chen Bing relayed central 
 directives, and Chai Qikun delivered the report on behalf of the ZPC. Chai 
 advocated the mutually-exclusive policies of simultaneously strengthening party 
 leadership while giving "free rein to the masses . He stated that the campaign 
 would link up with the "realities of class struggle" in the province - a phrase 
 which indicated that personal vendettas and powerplays were taking place in the 
 upper echelons of the leadership. In the long-practised tradition of Chinese 
 political campaigns, Chai proposed the establishment of experimental points and 
  the training of backbone elements. A Zhejiang Daily article of 1 February had 
  sanctioned the formation of special contingents drawn principally from among 
  workers, peasants and soldiers.65 According to sources in Taiwan, the CCP CC 
  issued an eight-point directive in February prohibiting armed struggle, the 
  "exchange of revolutionary experience", and other activities which had been 
  popularized by the Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution.66 These constraints 
  clearly assisted the provincial leadership in keeping the campaign in low gear, for 
  the moment at least. 
144 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

      Four days after this rally, provincial-level administrative organs held an 
oath-taking rally which was attended by provincial civilian and military leaders.67 
The moderation of the gathering can be gauged from the praise that it directed 
 toward Jiang Qing's model anti-chemical warfare company for its contributions to 
 farm-work in Zhejiang. Although militant slogans were shouted, the singing of 
 the PLA's "three discipline and eight points for attention" signified an orderly 
 atmosphere. One ominous note for the provincial party leaders, however, was the 
 suggestion that they play an active role in the campaign. 
      In stark contrast to the discipline and order on display at these rallies, on 7 
 February the workers’ congress mobilized 30,000 workers to attend a rally in 
 Exhibition Square.68 Slogans of the Cultural Revolution such as "It is right to rebel 
 against reactionaries" rang in the air in a "fervent atmosphere of unity and 
 militancy". The leadership of the ZPC did not attend, although members as well as 
 "responsible comrades" of the ZPRC, including Zhang Yongsheng and Weng 
 Senhe, were present. Leaders of the municipal party committee also attended. 
 Factories in Hangzhou, including Weng’s silk complex, sent along representatives 
 to address the gathering while others, including the iron and steel mill and the 
 Zhejiang Hemp Mill, submitted written statements. The speakers stressed that the 
 campaign should concern itself with concrete issues, otherwise it could "possibly 
 go astray and deviate from the orientation". In other words, rather than being 
 diverted by historical debates, it was suggested that the campaign should openly 
 target individual party leaders. In his closing speech He Xianchun appealed to the 
 city's workers to become the main force in the campaign and to "go against the 
 tide". A Deputy-secretary of HMC reportedly attacked the leaders of the provincial 
 committee by name for "not talking about the basic line" and asserted that "the 
 rightist trend in Zhejiang comes from responsible comrades of the ZPC".69 The 
 proceedings ended with a march through the streets of Hangzhou. 
       A further mobilization rally took place on 9 February 1974 for 500 members 
 of the provincial Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in 
 propaganda, cultural and education departments.70 It was sponsored by the 
 political work group of the ZPRC headed by Shen Ce, a "revolutionary reading 
 cadre" who together with Lai Keke had returned to prominence in 1967. Shen 
 appointed Weng Senhe a deputy-leader of the political work group at about this 
 time and allowed him to assume charge of the provincial office responsible for the 
 propaganda teams.71 These posts gave Weng the right to visit campuses where he 
 could display his oratorical skills to great effect.72 Weng’s office made its presence 
 felt very early in the campaign. On 9 February Zhejiang Daily carried a page one 
 ideological commentary concerning the anti-chemical warfare company. Certain 
 phrases offended the sensibilities of the political work group's staff who penned a 
 stinging missive on 11 February. The provincial daily finally frontpaged the reply 
                                                                 RENEWED RADICALISM 145 

on 10 March together with a craven apology for denigrating the role of workers 
and peasants in the campaign.73 
       On 13 February 80,000 tertiary and secondary students. Red Guards, teachers, 
and propaganda team members, assembled in Exhibition Square. They listened to 
a responsible member of the CCP ZPC demand a ruthless retaliatory strike at the 
"bourgeois counter-attack to settle old scores and to restore its influence". This 
theme was picked up three days later when the ZPC called a meeting of 
provincial-level cadres. The meeting "criticized the Rightist trend of thought of 
negating the great proletarian cultural revolution, linking the rightist trend 
closely with the current struggle between the two lines in our province".74 
       The meaning of these obscure and threatening references was spelled out at a 
conference on schistosomiasis [!] held in late February. The following passage was 
included in the broadcast relaying details of the conference: 

       In certain localities and units in Zhejiang some persons obstinately 
       maintaining the bourgeois reactionary stand have adopted all possible 
       means to reverse history, turned facts upside down, and have engaged 
       in all sorts of activities to turn back the wheel of history and restore the 
       old order and capitalism. They have negated all instructions issued by 
       Chairman Mao during the great proletarian cultural revolution, and 
       have overturned the brilliant decision endorsed by Chairman Mao and 
        the Party Central Committee on handling the question of the great 
        proletarian cultural revolution, in a vain attempt to reverse the correct 
        verdicts passed on them and to launch counter-attacks in retaliation. In 
        addition they have also endeavored to strike at the newly emerging 
        forces and have opposed such things as the revolution in education, in 
        literature and art, and in health work. May 7 cadre schools and work 
        regarding educated young people settled in the countryside.75 

        He Xianchun chaired a further lively rally in Hangzhou on 2 March 1974 in 
 his capacity as Vice-chairman of the ZPTUC. The gathering was sponsored by the 
 HMWC and attended by 30,000 of the city's workers. On 28 February the workers’ 
 congress had sent out invitations to district and county party organizations. In a 
 provocative letter of 25 February, Weng and He ordered Tan Qilong and Tie Ying 
 to attend the rally 76 Before party and mass leaders who had gathered from across 
 the province. Tan and Tie experienced the humiliation of listening to public 
 criticism of their leadership 77 The rally was to prove Tie's last public appearance 
 in Hangzhou for a year and he was, in his own words, subsequently "deprived of 
 the power ) to work".78According to a March 12 speech delivered by 
 Weng Senhe on Mt Pingfeng, provincial officials were at this time suspended for 

 investigation (#$&£), interrogated in isolation or 

 dismissed (jfftJjH-Hll’)-79 
        As if to support the rebels' action, on 15 March the People s Daily directed a 
 thinly-veiled blast at the policy of rehabilitating cadres who had been disgraced in 
146      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

the Cultural Revolution.80 The radical upsurge in the campaign which the 
editorial set off immediately made itself felt in Zhejiang. When the ZPC convened 
a second rally on 21 March 1974 great changes had occurred in the provincial 
leadership since February.8* At the 2 February mobilization rally ZPC leaders had 
spoken and issued directives. On 21 March the crowd was addressed by different 
leaders. Zhang Yongsheng presided over the rally and both Weng Senhe and He 
Xianchun were featured speakers. The "mountain top" faction leaders had, in no 
uncertain terms, taken over. The meteoric return to prominence of Cultural 
Revolution rebels was not confined to Zhejiang. The Hong Kong weekly Far 
Eastern Economic Review commented in May 1974 that "genuine Maoist 
revolutionaries" who had lost power after 1969 had "re-established their position 
through their membership of revolutionary committees. Although previously 
"eclipsed by the rebirth of CCP committees", the revolutionary committees now 
"commanded genuine influence" and were praised as an important creation of 

the Cultural Revolution.82 
       Tan Qilong spoke first at the 21 March rally. He 

       expressed his determination to plunge into the struggle together with 
       the broad masses of armymen and people and make severe criticism of 
       the reactionary ideological tide of attempting to restore capitalism. 

These words suggest that Tan had been placed in an extremely awkward position. 
By being forced to commit himself more actively to the campaign he was also 
losing the ability to protect subordinates such as Tie Ying and Xia Qi. The 
atmosphere at the meeting was militant and defiant. It demanded of leading 
 cadres that they lead the way in "making disclosures and criticism" so that they 
 could render "new meritorious service to the people". Shouts and cries 
 reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution mass rallies echoed across the square. The 
 report stated that a "very sharp and acute struggle" was in progress over the 
 assessment of the Cultural Revolution and the attempt to negate its "great 
 successes and achievements". Apart from Weng Senhe and He Xianchun, another 
 speaker was Wang Xing, 2nd Secretary of the CCP HMC and head of the Hangzhou 
 party committee's anti-Lin anti-Confucius small group.83 References to the need 
 to differentiate between the two kinds of contradictions and perfunctory remarks 
 about the state of the economy, were the only indication of any leavening of the 
 radicalism. The mood of the rally was summed up in the following sentence of 
 the monitored report: 

        It is required to exert continuously the revolutionary spirit of going 
        against the tide and display a firm stand and the true colors of one's 
        flags [sic] when dealing with questions of principle about the 
        proletarian cultural revolution.84 
                                                                 RENEWED RADICALISM 147 

       While it is true that Zhang Yongsheng, Weng Senhe and He Xianchun 
mounted the platform at provincial campaign rallies as standing committee 
members (and in Zhang's case Vice-chairman) of the ZPRC, their power was to 
extend well beyond these formal positions. On 22 June 1974, Weng Hongwen 
instructed the CCP ZPC leadership to allow the three rebels to attend meetings 
(?lj of its standing committee in the capacity of observers.85 Their presence 
would certainly have been unsettling to the other members. Attendance at the 
meetings provided the trio with direct access to the highest formal decision¬ 
making body in the province and the prestige accompanying such promotion. 
       More importantly, a provincial-level small group was especially established 
 to conduct the campaign. Jiang Qing was reported to have been the head of the 
central group in charge of the campaign. The group in Zhejiang was known as the 
 "double criticism small group" (J$ jtt'Mfl)-86 For the duration of the 
 campaign its authority exceeded that of the provincial party committee. Zhang 
 Yongsheng reportedly appointed the members of the group in consultation with 
 Deputy-party Secretary Chai Qikun, who turned down the offer of becoming group 
 leader so that, in his own words, he would retain the freedom to participate in 
 criticism of the provincial leadership.8'7 Tan Qilong was group leader and Chai, 
 Wang Xing, Weng Senhe and He Xianchun were among the deputy leaders. 
 Weng also was chairman of the office established to handle the administrative 

 side of the campaign.88 
       Control over the small group enabled the "mountain top" factional leaders, 
 in the words of articles written after their downfall, to lord it over (^ 

 zk or Place themselves above 
 _t.)90 the CCP ZPC. Small groups were also established throughout the ZPMD 
 system.91 According to a senior cadre from the Hangzhou party committee, Weng 
 Senhe and He Xianchun raised the question of establishing such a group in the 
 municipality at a meeting of the standing committee of the HMC in January 1974. 
 They described the small group as an advisory body to the standing committee 
                            Together with Second Secretary Wang Xing, 
 Weng and He drew up a namelist. Weng issued instructions that non-party 
 members could hold the position of deputy group leader and in that capacity could 
 attend party meetings at their units 92 He was thus attempting to bestow an 
 importance on the small groups which would give them equal status to party 
 committees as well as prodding party committees into admitting non-party leaders 
 into the CCP. Tie Ying later attributed the source of the rebels' power to Tan 
 Qilong, whose leadership of the group gave it a more official and impressive 
 appearance. Tie repeated an analogy borrowed by Weng Senhe from the Eastern 
 Zhou dynasty to accuse the rebels of manipulating the powerless emperor (Tan) to 
 order his subordinates about Weng also used the 
148 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

phrase to describe how the arrangement and membership of 

the small groups deceived party organizations. 

                                              Rebel Tactics 

1. Party Recruitment and Cadre Promotion 

       An important measure taken by the rebels to build up and reward their 
supporters was to place them in important party and government posts in the 
Hangzhou administration9* The ideological and political pretext was supplied by 
Mao's dictum regarding "combining the old, middle-aged and the young in party 
 committees. The organizational foundation was provided with the formation at 
 all levels across the province of campaign small groups, which legitimated the 
 admission of rebels into the CCP and their subsequent promotion to officialdom. 
 Weng Senhe listed four criteria for appointment: these were a high consciousness 
 in line struggle, an unblemished personal political history, a preference for party 
 members and active participation in the rebellion of late 1973 as proven by one's 

 presence on Mt. Pingfeng.95 
        It was at the municipal rather than at the provincial level that the 
 "mountain top" faction met the least opposition from sections of the party 
 leadership, and in certain cases passivity or even encouragement. Weng and his 
 colleagues realized that once they had set a precedent they could move both down 
 to the county and work unit level and up to the provincial level. To this end they 
 suggested to the ZPC that it instruct its subordinate body in Hangzhou to take the 
 initiative.96 Simultaneously, they attempted to paralyze the operation of party 
 branches in units of production by disruptive activities and then allow the 
 besieged leaders to take the blame for the resultant economic failures. Thus 
 Zhang, Weng and He elaborated a two-pronged strategy of infiltration and 
 confrontation. The novelty of the approach was commented upon several years 
 later by Tie Ying in a lecture he gave in 1980. Tie said that, "A few years back, 
 Zhang Yongsheng, Weng Senhe, He Xianchun and their ilk -- while roundly 
 cursing the Communist Party — exhausted every means to worm their way into 
 our party".97 The rebels had absorbed the lesson from their earlier participation in 
 mobilization politics that ultimately all power resided in the party, not in mass 
  organizations. 
        To make a breakthrough the rebels singled out three administrative sections 
  of the HMRC. The restoration of kou, which had taken place early in 1973, was 
  now characterized as a "product of restraining oneself and restoring the rites" and 
  an example of the "two negations and one reversal" (fEf 5—“(?!))/ a reference 
  to the negation of both the Cultural Revolution and its reforms (the so-called 
  "new-born things") and the reversal of the wheel of history. Members of the 
                                                                 RENEWED RADICALISM 149 

"mountain top" faction demanded the abolition of three kou — industry and 
communications, finance and trade, and planning -- which had been carved out of 
the Cultural Revolution production command group (^j1* 
The three particular kou were singled out because many of the old production 
command group cadres had themselves been rebels and had been demoted in the 
1972 reshuffle. Additionally, the rebels were able to enlist the support of two party 
secretaries of the HMC. On 4 and 7 February 1974, just as the anti-Lin anti- 
Confudus campaign was getting underway, the leaders of the old production 
command group convened meetings of its former cadre staff to prepare for a 
takeover. Immediately after the second meeting a delegation carrying the seal of 
the old group converged on a meeting place of the ZPC to obtain authorization for 
the changeover. The party secretary concerned refused and the cadres immediately 
declared a strike beginning at 9 pm in the offices of the three kou. He Xianchun 
arrived to congratulate them on their stand. 
       The next day, 8 February 1974, a notice appeared on the front gate of the 
 offices of the HMC compound notifying all staff of the strike, which lasted five 
 days. Wall posters and letters expressed solidarity with the officials' bold action. 
 Two secretaries of the HMC then applied pressure on the municipal authorities to 
 capitulate, which they did on 12 February. The three kou were disbanded and 
 replaced by a single group whose staff numbers were supplemented by the 
 appointment of fifteen cadres nominated by the "mountain top” faction. Xia 
 Genfa, a close ally of He Xianchun and Vice-chairman of the Hangzhou Oxygen 
 Generator Plant Revolutionary Committee, was appointed deputy leader of the 
 restored production command group. The hapless leaders of the three kou, who 
 had been deserted by their superiors, were shunted aside and placed under 
 investigation. Some were sent off to participate in supervised labor. With the 
 precedent set, a series of personnel changes swept the province, spreading up to 
 ZPC offices and down as far as factory, squad and shift leading groups." 
       By this action the radicals were demonstrating that they could force party 
 leaders to give ground. Additionally, they were flagging their ability to dictate 
 terms to the local cadres before the people of the province, who would have been 
 excused for wondering who really was running the administration in Zhejiang. 
 The humiliating cave-in undoubtedly helped undermine the credibility of the 
 Hangzhou administration and its functionaries. The rebels realized that their 
 tactics of destabilization and confrontation had proved spectacularly successful. 
 Therefore, on 19 March, the rebels presented an officials' list to the HMC (fT ^ 
 «j£) containing 60 names.100 The list had been drawn up in conjunction with 
 a document which Weng Senhe had drafted, entitled "Recommendations on 
 Solving the Problems of Zhejiang" and it demanded posts for members of Weng's 
 faction ranging from membership of the standing committee of the Hangzhou 
150 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

party committee through to various groups under its jurisdiction. One 
department pinpointed for close attention was the municipal Public Security 
Bureau. In March 1974 the rebels had convened another meeting at Mt. Pingfeng 
where they discussed how to gain control of this crucial "organ of the proletarian 
dictatorship". The posts of bureau deputy director and ten section heads had been 
included on the namelist. An ultimatum accompanying the namelist allowed the 

HMC a mere three days in which to agree. 
       By 28 March the HMC had again capitulated and 50 "new-born forces" were 
appointed to the leadership teams of its three major groups (M) thirteen offices 
(#) and six bureaux (Jg). Nine of Weng and He's nominees joined the standing 
committee of the CCP HMC.101 The appointment of He Xianchun as Deputy¬ 
secretary of the CCP HMC was later graphically described in the following words. 
The standing committee met with Second Secretary Wang Xing in the chair. 

       [Wang] servilely asked He Xianchun. "Will we put you in old (^) 
       He?" He Xianchun had the nerve to say: "that would be best. In the 
       future I might be working at the provincial level but to have a position 
       in the municipality as well would be good." [Wang] said, "Fine. Declare 
       old He deputy party secretary of the municipal committee". He 
       [Xianchun] also said "promoting me without Weng Senhe is no good. 
       Put him down as well." [Wang] said: "Ok. Declare Weng Senhe deputy 
       party secretary of the municipal committee".102 

       The appointment of Huang Yintang to positions in the municipal Public 
 Security Bureau and militia headquarters followed a similar pattern.103 At 7 pm 
 on April 3, 1974, the standing committee of the HMC met in Hangzhou with 
 Weng Senhe and He Xianchun in attendance. Huang's name was put forward and 
 a brief resume of his background read into the record. Huang was thirty-six years 
 old and had an unblemished political background and family connections. He was 
 proposed for the posts of Deputy-director of the Public Security Bureau and deputy 
 party secretary of the militia party branch. A brief but illuminating exchange 
 ensued between Weng and He on the one hand, and an unnamed party official 
 (possibly Wang Xing) on the other. The party official asserted that Huang’s priority 
 lay in his public security post (presumably where his enthusiasm for factionalism 
 could be contained) while Weng and He stressed Huang's post in the militia. 
 Huang later became effective head of the bureau after the director was driven out 
 of office. Thus, a rebel who had spent time in jail in the early days of the Cultural 
 Revolution had turned the tables on his former prosecutors.104 Huang, who had 
 only just joined the CCP, immediately became a member of the Public Security

recruit party members were known as the "two crashthroughs" 0$^) -- crash 
admission into the party and crash promotion of cadres rJEr Jj| ^ 
                              To justify their actions, the rebels fell back on 
Article 12 (5) of the CCP statutes passed at the 10th Congress in 1973 which 
favoured "getting rid of the stale and taking in the fresh" and Article 5 which 
stipulated that 

       The leading bodies of the party at all levels shall be elected through 
       democratic consultation in accordance with the requirements for 
       successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution [as stipulated by 
       Mao in 1964] and the principle of combining the old, the middle-aged 
       and the young.107 

Two methods for recruiting party members favoured in Zhejiang were known as 
"flying across the sea" and "appointment from above" (_h§ 
^£). The former method circumvented established procedures by allowing 
candidates who faced opposition in their work-place to join at other units. The 
Hangzhou workers' congress and militia headquarters party branches proved ideal 
for this purpose. Where emit leaders sympathetic to the rebels ran party branches, 
they simply appointed new members.108 
       It was claimed that in 1974 in Hangzhou alone, 8,000 new CCP members were 
admitted to the party and 3,000 cadres promoted by these highly unorthodox 
means.109 Included among these new party members and "helicopter" cadres were 
alleged hooligans and thugs, vandals, criminals and those with a family grudge 
(■fi '(tl-ft-?)- Some people entered the party one day and were promoted as 
officials the next. Some were appointed secretaries of party committees before they 
had joined the CCP. The most trusted of Zhang, Weng and He’s followers joined 
the campaign small groups but they also placed them in such sensitive areas as the 
provincial party office, defence department office, provincial education office and 
Zhejiang Daily.110 With Shen Ce and Weng Senhe in charge of the provincial 
political work group, which had the power to approve all such appointments, 
there were few institutional obstacles in the rebels’ path. Zhang Yongsheng was 
also present at meetings of the group where such promotions were discussed.111 
       The CCP ZPC seemed powerless to stop the flouting of party statutes and 
cadre regulations. Weng Senhe, in his inimitable style, used the following analogy 
to describe the dispatch of new cadres into positions of power: "Just as hens lay 
chicks so we must send out batch after batch".112 Zhang Yongsheng established a 
test case at his unit, the Zhejiang Fine Arts College. On 19 May 1974, which was 
the sixth anniversary of his meeting with Jiang Qing in Beijing (see chapter three), 
Zhang wrote Jiang a pledge of continuing loyalty Q&'fr^fS)-113 In one month 
he appointed ten people to the campaign small group in the college and then, in 
July, reorganized its party committee, assuming the post of party secretary himself 
152 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

with his old comrade Du Yingxin as deputy party secretary. Zhang also took 
control of the provincial revolution-in-education group and implemented the 
"two crashthroughs" in educational institutions throughout Zhejiang.114 
       A report of 30 June 1974 referred to the light industrial sector as a model in 
carrying out the policy of inducting new members into the CCP "in accordance 
with the provisions of the new party constitution".115 Weng Senhe, in his capacity 
as member of the ZPRC standing committee, was responsible for the sector. The 
party newcomers were described as "advanced proletarian elements who have 
emerged from class struggle and the struggle between the two lines" and "have 
become imbued with the revolutionary spirit of daring to go against the tide . The 
article claimed that the greenhorns worked "closely together with veteran party 
members" and the people called them "revolutionary young tigers". 

2. The Urban Militia 

       On 29 September 1973 a joint editorial of the People's Daily and Liberation 
 Army Daily had called for a build-up of urban militia forces along the lines of 
 contingents that had been experimented with in the mid-1960s. Articles which 
 accompanied the editorial described the activities of the urban militia in Beijing, 
 Shanghai, and Tianjin. In these cities the militia had three major tasks - to 
 participate in class struggle, to carry out patrol and guard duties, and to defend the 
 population in times of war.116 The description of the tasks was a euphemistic way 
 of stating that the urban militia would take a partisan stand in local factional 
 disputes, that it would take over guard duties from public security bureaux and 
 the military and that it would challenge the PLA's right to sole possession and use 
 of modern armaments. 
       The significance of the Shanghai militia experience (under Wang Hongwen’s 
 direction) was based on several factors. First, Wang and Ni Zhifu, who 
 commanded the Beijing urban militia, did so because they held the post of 
 Chairman of the municipal trade union council (or workers' congress). The urban 
 militia was therefore placed under union leadership. Second, the urban militia 
 commands were responsible to the municipal party committees (and ultimately to 
 provincial party committees), and not the military districts, which had previously 
 organized and trained such forces. Finally, Shanghai emphasized an ongoing 
 program of political education and study for the enlisted workers so they could 
 raise their political awareness.117 

        The factional nature of the urban militia which was established in Hangzhou 
 added a further dimension to divisions within the city's working class. The 
 practice of allowing workers who were regularly absent from the shop-floor to 
 draw full pay as well as subsidies for their militia service aroused resentment 
 from other workers who remained at their posts and in some cases were victims 
                                                                 RENEWED RADICALISM 153 

of the militia. The establishment of a party branch at militia headquarters enabled 
the militia to recruit new party members who for various reasons could not join 
the CCP at their own factories. The militia thus served as a springboard to launch 
the careers of several controversial figures in Hangzhou. 
       Xia Qi, Deputy Political Commissar of the ZPMD, may well have tried to 
delay or resist the formation of urban militia commands in Zhejiang. A 
commentary which was broadcast over the provincial radio on the eve of the 
publication of the People's Daily's 29 September 1973 editorial, emphasized the 
more traditional view of the militia as a production and military force.118 This 
stand contrasted strongly with the radical position which was enunciated in the 
People’s Daily editorial on the following day. In October 1973 the ZPMD, under the 
direction of the CCP ZPC, called a meeting to discuss the new orientation in 
militia work. Xia Qi delivered a mobilization report to an audience which was 
composed of representatives of county-level PLA units. There is little evidence 
that at the October meeting or in a December speech reviewing the year's work in 
the military that Xia openly expressed reservations about the direction in which 
militia work was heading. The only hint of difference was the attempt to place 
class struggle in the context of the two other "revolutionary movements" -- the 
struggle for production and scientific achievement.119 
       If Xia’s intentions were to go against the radical tide on the issue of the 
militia he was ultimately unsuccessful. The establishment of the HMMCH took 
place on 14 February, although the public announcement did not appear until 
eight days later.120 The notice in Zhejiang Daily stated that with the approval of 
 the ZPC, the CCP HMC had decided to form the militia command headquarters. 
The notice added that the Hangzhou urban militia would base itself on the 
 experience of its counterpart in Shanghai, particularly in relation to participation 
 in class struggle. In trying to explain why party leaders had consented to the 
 establishment of the urban militia, the local press later claimed that they had been 
 coerced into giving approval. The Hangzhou Daily asserted that on 14 February 
 1974 Weng and a group of his followers had gone to the office of the ZPC and "like 
 poisonous snakes entwined themselves around the leaders of the ZPC and 
 ordered them to answer questions, listen to ideas, and express their opinions and 
 then forced them to sign things". The rebels had allegedly assaulted PLA guards 
 on duty at the building and then accused them of starting the fracas. Xia Genfa told 
 a Xinhua reporter at the scene: "If the ZPC doesn t recognize its mistakes, in three 
 days the working class of Hangzhou will give it something to think about .121 In 
 1975, after Weng Senhe’s arrest, one of his colleagues alleged that Weng had 
 boasted of how he had coerced Hangzhou’s First Secretary Wang Zida into 
 agreeing to the militia's establishment. Much more probable is Weng's confession 
 that senior members of the HMC favored the formation of the organization.122 
154       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

       The establishment of urban militia headquarters was party policy. Not all 
major cities implemented the policy and some were reluctant to do so, judging by 
the tardiness of their response. That Hangzhou established its militia HQ 
promptly was a sign either that it wished to display its enthusiasm for the policy, 
and by implication other radical initiatives, or more likely that Wang Hongwen 
personally intervened to ensure the speedy implementation of central policy. The 
party leaders in Zhejiang found little room for manoeuvre with such close and 

 constant scrutiny of their performance. 
       All fifty-nine counties and municipalities in Zhejiang established militia 
 commands. Hangzhou’s urban militia had a paper strength of 50,000 men. It set 
 up office in the Workers' Cultural Palace, a centrally located building in 
 downtown Hangzhou, with an initial staff of 70 personnel seconded from Weng's 
 silk complex and the Hangzhou Oxygen Generator Plant. Operating expenses were 
 initially provided by the municipal government.123 The militia was mobilized 
 10,000 men/times (Aft) and detained 1,000 people. In the twelve or so 
 months of its existence it was involved in thirteen factional fights in the city.124 
 The HMMCH ran at least three detention centers, charmingly named "processing 
 factories" ftUXft), where it confined, interrogated and tortured its victims, 
 principally from the "mountain base" faction. Captives were forced to stand on 
 one leg for extended periods of time (^ v£), stand in the sun, or were 
 hung by the fingers, and savagely beaten. Some internees suffered permanent 
 incapacitation while others died. Wearing cane hats and armed with steel 
 fashioned from five tonnes of steel piping requisitioned from the Hangzhou Iron 
  and Steel Mill, militiamen soon became a common and dreaded sight on the 
  streets of Hangzhou. 
        Contingents of militiamen, some bearing arms, were also ferried around in 
  trucks, whose wailing sirens sounded like fire-engines (one of the militia's 
  functions was to act as a fire-fighting unit). Some militiamen were sent out to 
  infiltrate crowds which gathered before wall posters. Anyone who pasted up a 
  poster which contained unflattering remarks about the militia would have a chalk 
  mark applied to the back so that he or she could be identified, detained and 
  beaten.125 Other militiamen in civilian clothes, carrying concealed iron dubs, beat 
  anyone who expressed reservations about the militia. A demobilized soldier at the 
  Hangzhou automobile engine plant was thrashed and permanently crippled for 
  condemning the use of physical violence. 
         He Xianchun, as Chairman of the Hangzhou workers' congress, 
  automatically became commander of the city's militia. He later handed over the 
  position to his deputy Xia Genfa from the oxygen generator factory. The old factory 
  militia units which had been commanded and trained by the ZPMD were 
  scrapped, on paper at least. He Xianchun's militia recruited "fighters going against 
                                                                 RENEWED RADICALISM 155 

the tide" as its backbone with the object of building a countervailing armed force 
to the PLA. He expressed the view that "at the moment a group of old rightists 
hold all military power" and therefore "we can't give power over the militia to 
the ZPMD". He was advised not to report back to leaders of the ZPC because "you 
don't know when they will approve".126 In a speech of 17 October 1974, Weng 
Senhe stated that the militia's role was to seize military power in the province.127 
With the ZPC on the defensive and the municipal authorities either unwilling to 
resist the rebels, or in collusion with them, the stage was set for a series of 
incidents which seriously disrupted public order and further polarized the city's 
working class. 
       Before the establishment of the militia, incidents involving workers and 
PLA guards had occurred in Hangzhou. In December 1973 roving bands insulted 
and beat PLA guards on duty outside provincial offices, hotels and jails. Some 
soldiers had their collar tabs and insignia torn off and their hats knocked off their 
heads. One such incident resulted in injuries to twenty-three soldiers. It was later 
claimed that not one soldier retaliated.128 By encouraging the provocations, Weng 
and He apparently aimed to prove that the PLA was incapable of maintaining 
public order and that an urban militia was thus indispensable for the task. 
       The militia aimed to put into operation Weng Senhe's maxim that "since 
ancient times every victory of a political group has been accompanied by the 
suppression of its opponents". On 21 February 1974, one day before the public 
announcement of the establishment of the HMMCH, the militia had its first taste 
of action in the downtown area of the provincial capital. Weng and He's factional 
opponents from the "mountain base" faction had gathered at three hostels near 
 the commercial center of Hangzhou. He Xianchuri and Xia Genfa despatched 
militiamen to investigate, with resultant disruption to public transport and social 
order. At 5 pm on the same day He and Xia issued an urgent notice ordering the 
militia to clear its opponents out of the hostels. Workers were mobilized from 
 twelve factories and a large-scale confrontation ensued. One hundred participants 
 and an unknown number of bystanders were injured in the melee.129 Property in 
 the two hostels valued at 100,000 yuan was damaged or smashed. So that the 
defendants could not contact their comrades for reinforcements, allies of the 
militia in the Telecommunications Bureau jammed the telephone lines into the 
buildings.130 This was the first such clash on the streets of Hangzhou since the 
factional battles of the 1960s. 
       The next major incident occurred on 17 March 1974. Details are scanty but it 
was claimed that several hundred people were apprehended and several score 
wounded. The militia sent a telegram to Wang Hongwen, putting its side of the 
story, and he replied expressing support.131 After these skirmishes the municipal 
party authorities moved to exercise some control over the militia's activities. In 
156 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

early April at a meeting convened to discuss political work in the militia, 
representatives expressed their determination to fight to defend the anti-Lin anh- 
Confucius campaign and to study Shanghai’s experience in running the 
organization.132 The view expressed at the meeting that the party should 
"absolutely" command and lead the militia was an obvious swipe at the PLA. As i 
 to demonstrate further that the military had no role to play in the operations of 
 the HMMCH, no PLA representative was present. The obligatory pledge to 
 combine productive labour with military training seemed to take formalistic 

 propaganda to the extreme. 
       The southern Zhejiang city of Wenzhou where bloody clashes had occurred 
 in 1967 and 1968 (see chapters two and three) experienced more trouble at the end 
 of 1973- A report of November referred to militia activities at the Wenzhou 
 Scissors Factory. It stated that militia contingents, under the "unified leadership of 
 the municipal party committee" and armed with rifles and machine-guns, carried 
 out street patrols and participated in class struggle - a euphemism for factional 
 fighting.133 The city's militia command held a rally in May 1974 and the report 
 about the meeting stated that the organization had been established "amidst a 
 fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines and had devoted the 
 previous two months to studying the experience of the model Shanghai 
 command. It had also, continued the account, 

        mobilized the militiamen, with industrial workers as the main force, 
        resolutely to implement the series of important instructions issued by 
        the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, participate 
        actively in class struggle in society, and fight against the sinister 
        activities of a handful of class enemies aimed at undermining the 
        movement to criticize Lin Biao and Confucius. By so doing [it has] 
        safeguarded State property and the peoples' lives, fully demonstrating 
         the mighty power of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The people s 
         masses [sic] have ardently lauded them as "iron fists for smashing the 
         enemy" and "Red sentries who protect the people."134 

  Unlike the April rally in Hangzhou, however, representatives of the PLA were in 

  attendance in Wenzhou. 
         In other parts of the province rebels seized control of the militia, as in Jiande 
  county on 20 May.135 In Lanxi county, when the militia command was set up on 6 
  June the local branch of United Headquarters took charge. Factional fighting broke 
   out between this militia group and an independent county militia corps (-§. ^ 
   -^$5 Alffl) which had previously been established on 2 June 1970.136 This 
   corps most probably supported the local mass organization formerly aligned with 
   Red Storm and now with the "mountain base" faction. In Linhai county, a faction- 
   based Public Order General Headquarters (£i] was established on 
   12 April 1974.137 Thus, in 1974 the mass organizations were very much alive, not 
                                                RENEWED RADICALISM 157 

only in Hangzhou, but in the county towns of Zhejiang. 
     The civilian and military authorities' efforts to bring the militia under 
control in the second half of 1974 were not very successful. On 11 August 1974 
another major incident occurred, this time at the Hangzhou Iron and Steel Mill. It 
is claimed that on 10 August Zhang, Weng and He, together with their supporters 
in the mill, held a meeting at Weng's retreat on Three Terrace mountain 
(H o' ill) in the south-western hills around Hangzhou, to discuss ways of 
dealing with their opponents. It was decided to seize Zhang Jifa in a 
pre-emptive strike against the "mountain base" faction. Zhang was a workshop 
cadre at the iron and steel mill, which seems to have been a bastion of the anti- 
Weng forces. The militia had pledged to flatten (S^^f) the mill and crush its 
opponents there.138 
     The next day at about 8 am, Zhang Jifa and fellow-workers from the mill, as 
well as employees at Guo Zhisong's Zhejiang Construction Company, the 
Hangzhou Glass Factory (another large enterprise near the iron and steel mill in 
Banshan), hung a large banner outside the Overseas Chinese Hotel on Hubin 
($§}£), the road running parallel to the east bank of the West Lake, and 
placed big-character posters on walls near the department store in downtown 
Hangzhou. The banner contained a brief message directed against the proceedings 
of a lengthy provincial conference which had just drawn to a conclusion in the 
city (see the following section). The urban militia arrived in full battle-dress to 
arrest those who were reading the banner and posters.139 When Zhang led his 
group forward to resist, a fight developed. The scuffle must have reached an 
inconclusive end because the militia pursued Zhang and his supporters all the 
way back to the mill. A fire then broke out, partly burning the mill's auditorium. 
Each side blamed the other.140 Whoever was responsible, this incident further 
inflamed factional antagonisms and contributed to the atmosphere of lawlessness 
in Hangzhou. 
     Four other examples testify to the bitter and prolonged nature of the factional 
antagonisms in Hangzhou. The first also concerns Zhang Jifa, already mentioned 
above. In April 1974 Zhang, a demobilized soldier who had once worked in 
Beijing guarding important buildings, had obtained a record of Wang Hongwen's 
telephone calls to Zhang Yongsheng. Supporters of Zhang Yongsheng in the iron 
and steel mill where Zhang Jifa worked would pat their pockets and boast that 
"we've got access to the highest authorities; in here we've got Vice-chairman 
Wang's phone call to Zhang Yongsheng". Part of the transcript read: "the current 
situation is very favorable to you and I hope you do big things. But don't create 
the impression that you are reversing the verdict on X and X" [a reference to Nan 
Ping and Xiong Yingtang, Lin Biao’s purged military followers in Zhejiang]. After 
Zhang Jifa obtained the documents he decided to go to Beijing to pass them on to 
158 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

officials who had contacts with central leaders. When Zhang's enemies discovered 
his intentions they attempted to track him down. Zhang boarded a tram for the 
national capital and, after doubling back on his tracks to shake off his pursuers, 
 arrived in Beijing on 7 May 1974. He passed on the material to central "leading 
 comrades" and then returned to Hangzhou.141 Zhang was eventually arrested on 
 2 September and charged with responsibility for the 11 August fire at his mill. For 
 the next fourteen hours he was interrogated and tortured by the militia, who 
 threatened to throw him into the factory’s coke oven. Zhang was held for four 
 months during which time he was tortured seventeen times, suffering broken ribs 
 and a fractured arm, kidney damage, a punctured eardrum, severe concussion and 
 astigmatism to the right eye. 
      The second instance also illustrates the ferocity of factional vendettas. Li 
 Longbiao was a worker at the Hangzhou Worker-Peasant Bean Products factory. 
 His father, Li Baoxing, was a worker at the Zhejiang Hemp Mill where factional 
 differences were particularly acute. In August 1974 the elder Li fled the mill, 
 fearing for his personal safety because he was a member of the "mountain base" 
 faction opposed to Weng and He and was so known to them. On 11 August, the 
 day of the fire at the iron and steel mill, the younger Li went there in search of his 
 father, a further illustration of how factional antagonisms had involved 
 employees of many of the city's industrial plants. Li Longbiao was seized by the 
 militia and taken to its headquarters. There he was recognized as Li Baoxing’s son 
 and accused of arson. After a beating he was incarcerated in a secret prison and 
 held for a month. For a further month and a half he was kept in solitary 
 confinement before his release in late October 1974. Li, who was only thirty-five at 
 the time, emerged a paraplegic.142 
       The third example concerns Yao Guolin, the leader of Wenzhou's Rebel 
 General HQ in the 1960s. In 1967 and again in 1968, Yao had led the organization 
 in guerrilla warfare against United Headquarters as well as units of the 20th Army, 
 before the military had suppressed it (see chapters two and three). Yao had been 
  arrested and jailed. When tensions erupted in Wenzhou again in 1974, Wang 
  Hongwen intervened to denounce the local forces opposed to the "mountain top" 
  faction as brigands (see next section). Yao Guolin, who had been released from 
  prison, was the leader of the Wenzhou "brigands". On March 13, 1974, with 
  fighting having broken out again in Wenzhou, the provincial authorities issued a 
  warrant for Yao's arrest.143 At a public rally in June 1974 Yao was denounced and 
  paraded before the masses. Weng Senhe chaired the rally and Zhang Yongsheng 
  was one of the four speakers. Provincial and municipal civilian and military party 
  leaders attended and following the rally Yao was incarcerated once again.144 
       Qiu Honggen was another long-time foe of Weng Senhe and United 
  Headquarters. In 1969, along with Fang Jianwen and other Red Storm diehards. 
                                                        RENEWED RADICALISM 159 

Qiu had refused to join the alliance with United Headquarters (see chapter four). 
He had been arrested, imprisoned and only released in early 1973 (see chapter six). 
In June 1974 Qiu joined Yao in the dock at the public rally. He had written signed 
letters to Beijing complaining about the activities of the Hangzhou urban militia 
and had been arrested once more. Years later, Qiu proudly remembered his defiant 
attitude at the rally where, by holding his head high and smiling, he contravened 
regulations for a prisoner's demeanor on such occasions.145 
      The viciousness and vindictiveness of the factional struggle was amply 
 demonstrated in incidents detailed above. The factionalism, of which the fighting 
was only one manifestation, disrupted production and normal government. The 
battles between United Headquarters and Red Storm in the years 1967-69 had been 
fought with weapons looted from military armories. In 1974 the militia HQ was 
 the officially-sanctioned strike force of the "mountain top" faction and was 
entitled to arm its members. Its opponents in the "mountain base" faction took 
over the previous militia organization, and with supportive military leaders 
looking the other way or actively encouraging them, took up the gauntlet thrown 
down by the Zhang/Weng/He rebel trio. In the middle of 1974 "posters appeared 
in Hangzhou, signed by the city's militia command, condemning an illegally 
established provincial militia command".146 Thus the change in the nature of the 
factional battles and the organizations involved from 1967-69 typified the change 
in the nature of rebellion and factionalism from that earlier period. 

3. Pressure on the PLA 

      The weight of the evidence suggests that the PLA was the principal target of 
the anti-Lin anti-Confucius campaign. Zhou Enlai was the radicals' main 
individual object of attack but it was the military as an institution, and its senior 
regional commanders in particular, which came under fire.147 In December 1973 
Mao had transferred regional commanders as well as expressing dissatisfaction 
with the running of the CC MAC. Alarm at the implications of the campaign for 
the military may have prompted Ye Jianying to write to Mao on 30 January 1974 
expressing his concern.148 At the Politburo meeting of 31 January 1974, Zhou Enlai 
had attempted to restrict the scope of the campaign within the PLA.149 By 
protecting his military allies, Zhou was at the same time shoring up his own 
position. 
      At a meeting on 8 February 1974 Wang Hongwen and Zhang Chunqiao called 
the PLA general staff leadership "as far right as you could go" and stated that 
power should be seized in the General Political Department (where Zhang had 
recently been appointed director).150 On 5 March 1974 Jiang Qing spoke 
disparagingly of the leaders of the military. As if by signal the slogan "knock down 
the big warlords" appeared in the streets of the capital and elsewhere, with what 
160     CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

was later claimed as serious repercussions for discipline in the army.151 The 
reverberations of Jiang’s speech were felt in Zhejiang.152 In speeches to military 
cadres shortly afterward, Wang Hongwen and Zhang Chunqiao elaborated on 
Jiang's theme. Wang claimed that revisionism was rife in the PLA and that if war 
broke out only the militia could be relied upon. In a speech at General Staff 
Headquarters he suggested that 

      It is necessary to suppress continuously the Rightist ideology, to 
      mobilize the masses to make exposures, and open the lid on the top 
      echelon. It's difficult but not too difficult. This time we must make a 
      resolution: we must open up the lid, smash it if it cannot be opened, 
      and blow it open if it cannot be smashed.153 

Wang was thus calling for a repetition of the type of anarchical behavior which 
had occurred in 1966-67. On 11 March, as another sign of her suspicion of the 
 military Jiang Qing, in the name of the Politburo, ordered the PLA newspaper 
 Liberation Army Daily to cease compiling and carrying its own articles.154 
      Zhang, Weng and He did their best to carry out the spirit of Wang 
 Hongwen's March speech to "blow open the lid" of ZPMD party committees. 
 Their direct targets were the leading political cadres of the ZPMD, Xia Qi, Tie Ying 
 and Tan Qilong, all of whom owed their positions to Xu Shiyou and Zhou Enlai. 
 But ultimately they seemed to be aiming at Xu and Zhou. In 1972, Xia and Tie in 
 particular had most likely mounted a witch-hunt against leftist military cadres 
 and their rebel allies. Now it was their turn to feel the heat of the political 
 blowtorch. 
      Jiang Qing's choice of the anti-chemical warfare company in Zhejiang to 
 carry the banner of the campaign against Lin Biao and Confucius in the military 
 posed serious problems for Xia Qi. As the commissar in charge of political work in 
 the military district, Xia was expected to promote Jiang Qing's model, repressing 
 any distaste he may have felt for the task. From early February 1974 articles 
 praising the company for its contributions to the campaign appeared almost daily 
 in the provincial press.155 
       The problem that Jiang Qing's interest in the company was causing the 
 Zhejiang leaders was compounded by Wang Hongwen's renewed intervention in 
 provincial affairs. From 16 to 19 March 1974 he telephoned the Zhejiang 
 leadership each day to inquire about armed struggle which had erupted in 
 Wenzhou. Due to misunderstanding or deliberate misinterpretation, the ZPMD's 
 failure to respond adequately to Wang's directives to bring the situation under 
 control, resulted in three charges being levelled against the provincial military 
 leaders. First, they were accused of failing to collect weapons from the warring 
 groups; second of having fabricated Wang Hongwen's directives; and third of 
 having acted as the "back-stage boss to local brigands" (ill =2/a 'n )-156 
                                                       RENEWED RADICALISM 161 

It can be assumed that sections of the local military were supporting groups 
opposed to the "mountain top" rebels, in the same way as they had sponsored 
groups to fight against United Headquarters in 1967-68. To increase further the 
pressure on Xia Qi and his superiors, in mid 1974 Zhang Chunqiao and Ding 
Sheng despatched Li Bincheng, Political Commissar of the Nanjing Artillery 
Units, to Hangzhou as Political Commissar of the ZPMD. Li outranked Xia and 
was subordinate only to Tan and Tie. 
      The confrontational style of politics utilized so effectively by the "mountain 
top" leaders was lethal when backed up by central leaders such as Wang Hongwen. 
Zhang, Weng and He had coerced the authorities, especially the Hangzhou party 
leadership, into agreeing to the appointment of their supporters to responsible 
party posts. They had set up a militia command with He Xianchun in charge. 
Their next step was to apply further pressure to Tan Qilong, Tie Ying and Xia Qi. 
Tie and Xia had already lost the right to attend public engagements, while Tan 
seems to have appeased the rebels by going along with the campaign, perhaps in 
the hope of blunting it. As a provincial first secretary he really had no option but 
to implement central policies, whether these were moderate or radical. Direct 
orders were difficult to circumvent or sabotage. At the same time, he would have 
tried to protect Tie and Xia to the best of his ability and inclinations, especially 
considering that the 1972-73 purge of the radicals which they had carried out had 
undoubtedly received his blessing and enthusiastic support. 
      On 26 March 1974157 a meeting of great significance for the provincial 
leadership opened in Hangzhou. It was a joint meeting of the CCP ZPC, ZPRC and 
the party committee of the ZPMD and was known as the triple plenum (H 
^.^.) 158 Triple plenums later opened in Hangzhou on 15 May and in 
prefectures and counties across the province, paralyzing the work of party 
committees.159 It is alleged that CC document No. 17 of 1974 authorized the 
formation of provincial-level committees with the aim of promoting unity 
among party, government and military leaders.160 The experience of Zhejiang 
illustrates that if this was the intention of the center, things went badly wrong. 
From the time of its opening until its closure in early August, after a marathon 
sitting which lasted with interruptions for 133 days, the triple plenum became a 
forum for the airing of personal grudges and grave accusations. The forum 
enabled the "mountain top" rebels to exert a degree of control over the 
organization where they had least influence, the ZPMD and its party committees. 
They were able to dilute its influence by outnumbering military delegates with 
members from the CCP ZPC and the ZPRC, where they had greater representation. 
Whether the plenum foreshadowed a major change in the organizational 
structure and personnel of the provincial leadership is unclear. Certainly, Zhang 
Yongsheng was accused of attempting such a reform at Jiande county by 
162     CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

amalgamating party, government and military leading groups into a single body 
             y!61 
    Hphe plenum selected an investigation group headed by Shen Ce to examine 
the verdicts passed on Lin Biao's local supporters and their rebel allies by a special 
case group in 1972. The high-ranking cadres who had been investigated m 1972 
included Shen himself, provincial Deputy-secretary Chai Qikun, Hangzhou First 
Secretary Wang Zida and possibly Zhu Quanlin, a military cadre from the 20th 
Army.162 Members of the investigation group included personnel from the 
municipal militia headquarters. Military cadres were summoned for questioning, 
cadres' personal files examined, and records of meetings, archives and documents 
relating to defence preparations perused. On 16 April, Chai Qikun and He 
Xianchun led the investigation team to the offices of the provincial special case 
group to seize material the group had collected relating to Zhang Yongsheng s 
connections with Lin Gang. Lin was the Qinghua University leader who had 
played such an important liaison role in Zhejiang during 1966-67 and was now 
condemned as a counter-revolutionary and "May 16 element"163 (see chapters one 
and six). 
      Zhang and Weng toured military units, including those under the 
jurisdiction of the 5th Air Force and 20th Army. They denounced commanders as 
revisionists and called on the troops to break the master-serf relationship which 
 they claimed characterized relations between officers and men. They also asserted 
 that the PLA was politically unreliable and that the urban militia would be used to 
 put down a military insurrection. The militia further provoked the military by 
 attacking its offices, occupying cadres' hostels, cutting the supply of food and water 
 and transport and communication links to units stationed in Hangzhou, and 
 firing on army camps.164 
      Although he was ill, Tie Ying was dragged into "criticism and struggle 
 auditoriums" In order to 
 escape the severe harassment Xia Qi fled to a hospital. Wang Hongwen ordered 
 him back or face dismissal. On 7 April 1974 events took another turn for the worse 
 for Xia. On that day the Hangzhou Daily published an article entitled "Struggle to 
 the end with the bourgeois restorationist forces".166 Wang Hongwen telephoned 
 the forum, then in session, and in referring to Xia Qi left off the two characters 
 "comrade"([a] ^). The rebels seized upon the omission to declare that Xia’s case 
 had become one involving an antagonistic contradiction. He was suspended from 
 his positions, subjected to isolated interrogation from a special case group and 
 made the object of attack at meetings which continued over the next five months. 
 The rebels labelled Xia a "representative of restorationist forces", a "class enemy 
 who has wormed his way into the PLA" and a "revisionist". Wang Hongwen later 
 confessed, "Ah! I wasn't careful when I phoned, and left off the two characters 
                                                        RENEWED RADICALISM 163 

'comrade'. You went a bit far".167 [!] In a speech of 23 May Weng Senhe was 
adamant that rank would not protect any cadre from criticism.168 
      On 7 August 1974 the provincial triple plenum finally came to an end, after 
months of debate and controversy.169 The sanitized report which was issued to 
 sum up the meeting was a compromise document. On the one hand it urged 
 "leading cadres who have made mistakes" [Tie Ying and Xia Qi] to "correctly 
 handle the mass criticism, seriously conduct self-criticism, correct their mistakes 
 courageously and reinforce their spirit to work hard". On the other hand it 
 referred to "bourgeois factionalism" within the ranks of the masses and asked 
 those who were guilty to recognize their errors. The final point of the 
 communique specified the hegemony of the party over all other organizations, 
 including the campaign small groups. It stated: 

      The movement to criticize Lin Biao and Confucius must be carried out 
       under the centralized leadership of the Party committees. Military sub¬ 
       district commands and people's armed forces departments are the 
       military departments of local Party committees. Trade unions, 
       associations of poor and lower-middle peasants, women’s federations, 
       communist youth leagues, militia units and Red Guard organs are the 
       mass organizations led by the Party.170 

       The ZPC convened a meeting on 13 August to press home this message.171 
 It discussed the respective roles and relations between new and veteran cadres, 
 recommending that new cadres "should be given opportunities to work and their 
 role should be brought into full play" with the help of their older colleagues. 
 Speeches by Weng Senhe on 4 August and Zhang Yongsheng on 5 August at the 
 Zhejiang Workers Political College had been less compromising. The bitterness 
 which Document 16 of 1972 (see chapter six) continued to arouse was evident in 
 extracts from Weng’s speech. Xia Qi later wrote that the plenum had devoted 
 much of its time to the issue and to exactly what directives Zhou Enlai had issued 
 at the April 1972 meeting in Beijing. Zhang Yongsheng attacked Xu Shiyou and 
 praised the Shanghai Garrison for exposing Xu's political errors. Zhang boasted 
 that he could not wait (-fglf #) for the opportunity to resume his political 
 battle with Xu.172 
       The triple plenum also produced two internal reports. One, compiled on the 
 basis of the investigation of Xia Qi by the special case group, concluded that his 
 mistakes were sufficiently serious to be defined as an antagonistic contradiction. 
 The second report, dated 19 October173 and entitled "A Summary of the 133 Days' 
 Proceedings", requested that the CC "hold a relevant meeting at the appropriate 
 time to solve the problem of the Nanjing Units". Wang Hongwen and Zhang 
 Chunqiao had previously directed that the plenum would solve the question of 
 which headquarters Zhejiang took its orders from - Beijing or Nanjing. Weng 
164 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

Senhe had stated bluntly on 4 August 1974: 

     With Xia Qi in the ZPMD representing the right deviationist wind to 
     reverse correct verdicts, there's still that big chief in Nanjing [Xu 
     Shiyou]. Every wind to reverse verdicts in Zhejiang has been tied up 
     with Nanjing ...; principally it is Xia Qi and his chief in Nanjing - the 
     root is that big Commander.174 

Weng was referring to Xu Shiyou and his responsibility for the investigation of 
the rebels carried out in Zhejiang between 1972 and 1973. Zhang Yongsheng made 
the same links and insinuations in a speech of 8 October. Jiang Qing went one step 
further in linking Xu to Zhou Enlai.175 Tan, Tie and Xia were denied the right to 
submit dissenting reports. However, they drafted a joint letter to the CC, State 
Council and MAC setting forth their views, much to the displeasure of the rebel 
leaders. Wang Hongwen then ordered the provincial military leaders to Beijing 
and rebuked them for expressing disagreement with the reports.176 

The Struggle to Rein in and Conclude the Campaign, April - December 1974 

      On 8 April 1974, the day after Wang Hongwen's latest intervention, the ZPC 
and ZPRC held another rally to report on the progress of the anti-Lin anti- 
Confucius campaign.177 Its main purpose was to denounce Xia Qi, following 
Wang Hongwen’s comment of the previous day or, in the words of the report, to 
peel off all outer layers so as to "get down to the bottom of class struggle". Zhang 
Yongsheng chaired the meeting, with Tan Qilong, Chai Qikun and Weng Senhe 
the principal speakers. The meeting reported glowingly on the general situation 
and praised the masses for overcoming obstacles in maintaining the momentum 
of the campaign. Nevertheless, there were indications that the opponents of the 
"mountain top" leaders were putting up resistance. Reference to the "sabotage and 
disturbance of class enemies" and the attempt to distinguish between the 
"partisanship of the proletariat" and the "factionalism of the bourgeoisie" 
provided evidence that unrest in the province was serious. That the campaign 
had adversely affected industrial and agricultural production was tacitly admitted 
by the meeting's appeal to production workers to "make revolution after work”. 
      The People's Daily published an editorial on the subject of the economy on 
10 April.178 On the same day the CCP CC issued a notice specifying that the 
campaign must come under the unified leadership of party committees and 
forbidding the formation of fighting groups and inter-unit or inter-regional link¬ 
ups.179 The editorial and notice were undoubtedly issued as a result of a meeting 
called by the State Planning Commission, on the instructions of the Politburo, to 
discuss industrial production with the representatives of fifteen provincial-level 
administrations.180 
      The Zhejiang authorities did not respond publicly to the central initiative 
                                                        RENEWED RADICALISM 165 

until 20 April when they called a telephone hook-up meeting at which Tan, 
Zhang and Weng all spoke.181 The three urged leading cadres at all levels to 
handle correctly the relationship between revolution and production and to 
strengthen party leadership and the unity of cadres and citizens. More 
importantly, given the threat to stability posed by the triple plenum, the meeting 
declared: 

      Meetings which can be postponed, should be postponed. Meetings 
      which can be brought to a conclusion for the time being should be 
      brought to a conclusion for the time being. Meetings which cannot be 
      brought to a conclusion right away should be brought to a conclusion 
      in a few days. 

 This short report only hinted at the discontent felt by the party leadership about 
 the direction that the political campaign had taken. Tan, with the backing of 
 central leaders such as Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, may have finally taken the 
 fight up to the rebels. Mao’s statement of 1967, concerning the need for unity 
 among the working-class, was quoted and emphasis attached to the importance of 
 attaining targets set in the five-year plan.182 
       Chen Xia, who was a participant at the 20 April meeting, later claimed that 
 criticism was directed against factional fighting and the activities of the militia. 
 According to Chen, the CCP ZPC subsequently issued a series of directives 
 attempting to rein in the campaign. These included a request to bring it to an end 
 in basic production units ("the key points of the movement are at and above 
 county-level offices"), to stop the indiscriminate public naming of leading cadres 
 without the approval of relevant party committees, to steer away from the 
 obsession with personalities and power struggles ("don't haul out representatives 
 of restorationist forces at all levels") and to focus attention back on the economy. 
 However, Wang Xing, the leader of the Hangzhou campaign small group, 
 personally brought out a document rebutting these directives point by point. He 
 described the restrictions and regulations laid down by the ZPC as "setting rules 
 and regulations", and "binding hands and feet". The practice of naming cadres 
 continued unabated and the renewed emphasis on economic affairs was described 
 as "pitting revolution against production".183 
       Whatever the maneuverings which went on behind the scenes, the effect on 
  the rebels seemed minimal and short-lived. On 26 April 1974 the ZPC and ZPRC 
 held yet another conference at which the political rhetoric reached a new peak of 
 fervor and extravagance.184 Tan Qilong was not present at all, or if so, he did not 
  speak. Zhang Yongsheng presided, with Weng Senhe, Shen Ce, He Xianchun, 
 Chen Bing, the peasant philosopher Jiang Ruwang (see chapter five),185 and the 
  former Red Storm leader and Deputy-secretary of the Zhejiang CYL Liu Ying all 
  featured speakers. The consensus of opinion which emerged from the meeting 
166 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

was that the campaign was "raging like a prairie fire throughout the province , 
although the struggle remained "protracted, complex and arduous". The speakers 
vent their spleen on the "bourgeois forces of restoration" who intrigued and 
conspired, provoked sectarianism and division, tried to strangle new-born 
things" and even slandered the "great leader of the proletariat with bitter 
animosity". From the notice drafted by Weng Senhe for the meeting we can see 
that the verbal abuse was directed principally at Tie Ying and Xia Qi.186 
      At the symposium sponsored by the ZPTUC and the HMWC on 29 April 
1974, the eve of May Day, Chairwoman of the ZPTUC Jiang Baodi presided. The 
main speakers were Zhang Yongsheng, Hua Yinfeng and He Xianchun, all former 
United Headquarters’ activists.187 He Xianchun repeated Mao's dictum 
concerning the unity of the working class, but in the words of China News 
Summary, "no comment was made, and no enthusiasm for unity was shown".188 
Representatives of major industrial plants in Hangzhou, including Weng Senhe's 
silk complex, the iron and steel mill, and the oxygen generator plant attended and 
spoke. The urban militia and the propaganda teams also supplied speakers. The 
next day 600 workers from the propaganda teams were despatched to government 
departments and tertiary institutions to "strengthen further worker leadership 
over the various fields of the superstructure".189 Whether the propaganda teams 
were sent back into schools to stop student confrontations with authority and to 
"guide" the anti-Lin anti-Confucius campaign, as an observer in Hong Kong 
claimed,190 or whether their mission was to enlist students on the side of the 
"mountain top" faction is unclear. 
      In May 1974, Zhang, Weng and He published a joint article in Zhejiang Daily 
to commemorate the eighth anniversary of the 1966 May 16 Circular which had 
launched the Cultural Revolution.191 In their article the rebel trio were at pains to 
associate themselves and the current campaign with the mainstream of the 
Cultural Revolution, to dissociate themselves from any past affiliations with Lin 
Biao and his "agents" in Zhejiang192 and to refute accusations that they were 
"ultra-left”, "three anti's elements" (HjR.-fr2?-) that is, anti Mao, the PLA 
and revolutionary committees, or May 16 elements. It is clear that the old mass 
organization rebel leaders viewed the 1974 campaign as a second Cultural 
Revolution. The 1973 phrase "going against the tide" was equated in their minds 
with the 1966 slogan it is right to rebel".192 An article by former activists of 
United Headquarters argued that the campaign to criticize Lin Biao had already 
achieved considerable results while the efforts to tackle Confucius had only just 
begun and was a much more formidable task.194 The three authors of the article 
were Li Xiantong, (Hangzhou University) Yan Yihuan (Zhejiang University) and 
Du Yingxin (Zhejiang Fine Arts College), all leading activists of United 
Headquarters and, as this chapter has detailed, prominent members of the 
                                                       RENEWED RADICALISM 167 

"mountain top" faction. During the anti-Lin anti-Confucius campaign radicals 
directed their attacks primarily against Confucius, whom they equated with 
restoration, while moderates focused on Lin Biao who, despite Mao's December 
1972 comment describing Lin as an ultra-rightist, was associated in everyone's 
mind with the ultra-left extremism of the Cultural Revolution. 
      After a hiatus in May, public meetings and rallies resumed in June 1974. At a 
meeting which was organized by the ZPC and ZPRC and sponsored by the political 
work section of the ZPRC at the beginning of that month, further evidence that 
Zhang, Weng and He had acquired enormous influence within the provincial 
leadership emerged.195 He Xianchun presided over the meeting while Zhang and 
Weng, with Tan Qilong and Chai Qikun, were the principal speakers. The 
meeting expressed satisfaction at the development of the campaign over the 
previous months but cautioned that "the struggle is still acute and complicated". It 
also warned the audience not to become complacent "in the face of the excellent 
situation". 
      One of the three principal tasks of the urban militia, as specified in the 
September 1973 People's Daily editorial, was political eduction of the working 
class. To this end, on 5 June 1974 a school to train cadres and theorists from the 
workers of Zhejiang opened in Hangzhou.196 It was named the Zhejiang 
Workers' Political School and in its first semester enrolled 220 students. The 
 ZPTUC, with the approval of the provincial party committee, had organized the 
 school and set it the task of producing "experts for the Party who can write as well 
 as fight". Zhejiang had modelled its school on a similar institution in 
 Shanghai.197 The criteria for selection to study at the school included possessing "a 
 high awareness of the struggle between the two lines,... [courage] to go against the 
 tide and ... [being] activists in revolutionary mass criticism". Weng Senhe, in his 
 capacity as the "responsible person" of the school, delivered the speech at the 
 opening ceremony which was attended by Tan Qilong and Jiang Baodi among 
 others. The school was situated on Five Terrace mountain (E n ill) and 
 issued such publications as The Journal and Brief Biographies of Legalists 
 (^^^^rjxjs^).198 in addition to these publications, the rebels also 
 ran their own newspaper, the Zhejiang Worker (jjf jXX A)> which had been 
 United Headquarters' mouthpiece in the 1960s, and other journals.199 
       The rebels realized that a disastrous slump in industrial production in 
 Zhejiang would discredit the provincial leadership and that the longer they kept 
 up their tactics of destabilization the greater would be the deleterious effects on the 
 economy. At the conference held on 13 June to report on the campaign it was 
 asserted that the criticism of Lin and Confucius had actually promoted industrial 
 and agricultural production. This rash assessment concerning the state of the 
 economy was tempered, however, by a request to the people of the province to 
168 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

apply their "revolutionary enthusiasm" to productive endeavor. After a lengthy 
absence from the public eye during the campaign. Deputy-secretary of the CCP ZPC 
Lai Keke reappeared at the conference. His article concerning the campaign in 
Zhejiang Daily at the end of the month advocated a greater commitment to 
study.200 There were signs that a wind-up of the radicalism of the first half of 1974 
was imminent. The triple plenum temporarily closed its doors on 9 June, almost 
two months after the ZPC had issued instructions to this effect at the 20 April 
telephone conference, and the achievements in the campaign which were 
enumerated at the conference read like a valedictory notice.201 This impression 
was further reinforced by a photographic exhibition on the campaign which 
opened on 21 June 1974 at the Exhibition Building in Hangzhou. Tan Qilong cut 
the ribbon after Weng Senhe had delivered the speech at the opening 
ceremony.202 
      However, the rebels were not going to succumb without a final outburst of 
militancy. In this determination they were perhaps assisted by Jiang Qing’s hint in 
a speech of 14 June that the campaign should criticize the "contemporary 
Confucius" and the "big Confucian in the party"203 [Zhou Enlai], A belligerent 24 
June 1974 editorial of Zhejiang Daily advised party leaders to discard their 
perfunctory approach to the campaign and make up their minds whether to "carry 
out reforms or to maintain the old, whether to advance or to retrogress, and 
whether to make revolution or to restore the old order". The editorial 
commented: 

      The broad revolutionary masses have risen up in rebellion against a 
      handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and have dared to go 
      against the tide. Why have some comrades regarded this as "offending 
      one's superiors and creating havoc"? Why have some comrades felt 
      themselves incompatible with new things and new cadres that have 
      emerged in the great proletarian cultural revolution while always 
      thinking of the old? In every major struggle between the two lines, 
      why do some comrades fail to understand the struggle in the 
      beginning, stand opposed to the masses, and fail to take a step forward 
      until others remind them to do so?204 

      A militant rally whose participants were "filled with angry sentiments and 
hatred for the common enemy" was held on 30 June.205 The rally praised leading 
cadres who, in increasing numbers, had "stood at the forefront of the struggle, 
boldly led the movement and fought together with the masses". A full comple¬ 
ment of provincial, municipal and PLA leaders heard Tan Qilong, Chai Qikun 
and Weng Senhe lambast their colleagues, presumably Tie Ying and Xia Qi, who 
had not qualified for the above plaudits. Thus, the rebel cadres in Zhejiang retain¬ 
ed the initiative right up until the time when central authorities decided that the 
cost of the campaign to the Chinese economy had reached dangerous proportions.

Central Efforts to End the Campaign 

      On 1 July 1974, the CCP Central Committee issued an important document to 
bring the anti-Lin anti-Confucius campaign to an end.206 The document lamented 
the shortfalls in key production targets, especially in railway freight and coal 
production. Iron and steel as well as chemical fertilizer output and production for 
the military sector was also lagging. Receipts for the first five months of 1974 had 
fallen 500 million yuan short of outlays and the shortage of goods had created a 
 tight market for consumers.207 Document 21 also subjected two key slogans of the 
 campaign to analysis. The equation of "going against the tide" with rebellion 
 against party leadership was singled out for critical attention. Most cadres, argued 
 the circular, were good and to arrest or beat them even if they had made mistakes 
 did not conform with party policy. The CC ordered officials who had deserted their 
 posts to return to work and urged workers to go back to their factories.208 
      The other slogan adjudged erroneous was one which had been 
 enthusiastically propagated by Weng Senhe -- "don't work for the wrong political 
 line" (7f The document urged a greater 
 commitment to production, strict observance of discipline and a prohibition 
 against "link-ups" ($]$) and factional disturbances. It reserved the most 
 severe strictures for local leaders who had abandoned their responsibilities in the 
 face of difficulty, who implemented party policy selectively or who, worse still, 
 instigated or supported factional violence. These pointed remarks were directed 
 not only at rebel leaders such as Zhang, Weng and He, but also at cadres such as 
 Tan Qilong, who ultimately had to bear responsibility for the disorder in Zhejiang. 
 Mao Zedong, who had approved the CC Document of 1 July, warned the radical 
 leaders at the 17 July Politburo meeting not to form a small faction of four 
                                                On 1 June 1974 Zhou 
 Enlai had entered a hospital in Beijing from which he was never to reemerge, 
 except for brief public appearances at major events such as the 4th NPC in January 

 1975 210 Although the Chairman appointed Wang Hongwen to take charge of the 
 daily work of the CC during Zhou’s hospitalization,211 Deng Xiaoping had most 
 probably played a major role in drafting the document. 
       The clear expression of support for provincial administrations contained in 
 the central document, accompanied by a blunt order to concentrate on industrial 
 production, was certainly good news to first secretaries like Tan Qilong and a stern 
 warning to the rebels to fall into line or face the consequences. To regain control 
 over the provincial administration and check the anarchic behavior of the rebels, 
 Tan's first step was to reassert the authority of the ZPC over the campaign small 
 groups, the urban militia, the municipal workers' congress and the Mao Zedong 
 propaganda teams. All four bodies had come under the domination of Zhang, 
 Weng and He, and had been a constant source of trouble to Tan. 
170 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

      It seems that initial steps had already been taken to rein in the urban militia. 
At the 19 June rally to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the establishment of the 
people's militia. Tan Qilong had praised the work of the militia in Zhejiang's 
three largest cities -- Hangzhou, Ningbo and Wenzhou.242 He Xianchun, 
introduced as a member of the standing committee of the ZPRC, Vice-chairman of 
the HMRC and secretary of the municipal militia headquarters' party committee, 
delivered a report in which he stressed the subjection of the militia to the party. 
Provincial reports from Army Day indicated that with the exception of Shanghai, 
where it was asserted that the militia command remained outside PLA control, 
the PLA regained its control over the urban militia.213 By 29 September 1974 when 
2,000 militiamen assembled in Hangzhou to celebrate the 16th anniversary of 
Mao's call to build up the militia, greater moderation seemed to prevail 214 
Although it was stated that the urban militia continued to grow in size and 
strength, the themes of discipline and unity received some prominence. Apart 
from singing the PLA’s "three rules and eight points", the militia was asked to 
strengthen its internal unity and its relations with the city's citizens. Thus, the 
local authorities had finally succeeded in curtailing the militia's activities, for the 
moment at least. As for the propaganda teams, which were controlled by Weng 
Senhe, a report of the conference held from 20-28 July indicated that moves were 
afoot to bring them under closer party leadership.245 
      For the initial period after the release of the CC document, however, the 
rebel activists in Zhejiang remained defiant and insubordinate. At a mass meeting 
held by the ZPC on 5 July the leaders of the "mountain top" faction occupied 
center stage and seemed to treat the document with levity.246 While 
acknowledging the necessity to strengthen party leadership over the campaign, 
study the central document, devote attention to the economy, stop "exchanges of 
experience" and obey labor discipline, the speakers, who included He Xianchun, 
directed leading cadres to continue to give the campaign their highest priority. 
Furthermore, a Zhejiang Daily editor's note seemed to contradict a crucial 
argument in the 1 July CC directive when it stated that 

      Practice in the movement to criticize Lin and Confucius over the past 
      six months shows that where Party organizations have vigorously 
      grasped criticism of Lin Biao and Confucius and have followed the 
      correct ideological and political line, industrial production has 
      increased and the situation in both revolution and production is 
      excellent.247 

      The editor's note was appended to an article reporting a 19% increase in 
industrial production in Jiande county for the first six months of 1974 over the 
corresponding period for the previous year. The implications of this assertion 
were potentially explosive for Tan Qilong when figures for provincial industrial

production were compiled. The radicals could disclaim any responsibility for 
directly managing the economy. Production shortfalls would, on the one hand, 
upset the central leadership (with the exception of the radicals) and arouse 
discontent among the people of the province, and on the other hand would prove 
to the satisfaction of Tan's local opponents and their mentors that he had failed to 
carry out the political campaign. Either way Tan was damned. 
      A meeting to promote production and revive the campaign, which was 
called by the ZPC and ZPRC on 9 July 1974, declared in decisive terms that "All 
fields and organizations should work under the centralized leadership of Party 
committees".218 Tan Qilong spoke of the desirability for unity to supersede 
"bourgeois sectarianism" so that everyone could devote their energies to work. It 
was announced that agricultural production targets had been met in the first half 
of the year, but industrial production figures did not rate a mention, a clear 
indication of trouble in this sector. 
      Requests by the 1 July Central Committee document as well as the provincial 
 mass meeting of 5 July to end revolutionary "exchanges of experience" went 
 unheeded at the last major rally of the campaign on 22 July.219 An editorial of 28 
July 1974220 called for the momentum of the campaign to be maintained during 
 the oncoming busy farming season, but it was the last shot as the forces of 
 moderation took over. The changing balance of power at the center and the 
 publication of articles reflecting this shift221 assisted Tan regain the initiative in 
 Zhejiang. 
      With the termination of the campaign the attention of the central leaders 
 was brought back to the state of the economy. The CC document of 1 July had 
 pinpointed the problems in certain key industrial sectors and since that time 
 provincial leaders like Tan Qilong had struggled to come to grips with the 
 document's directives. In his speech on National Day 1974 Tan Qilong was 
 looking ahead. New tasks required new slogans and Tan referred to a quintet 
 which received a great deal of publicity over the following twelve months. These 
 slogans, which were popularized in the national press by the moderate leadership, 
 called for emphasis on the political line, unity, the overall situation, policy and 
 discipline 
      On 4 November 1974 the party leadership under Tan Qilong convened a 
 meeting to "grasp revolution and promote production" 223 The meeting 
 demanded that cadres change their style of work and go down to the grassroots to 
 rediscover reality. Senior cadres of the CCP HMC responded to these exhortations 
 by leading a group of two hundred cadres to take part in productive labor in the 
 city's factories. They listened to "workers' demands and opinions on improving 
 their work".224 Not to be outdone, their provincial civilian and military comrades, 
 led 1,300 cadres to work at the Hangzhou railway yards on 6 and 7 November.225 
172 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

Further meetings of 18 and 28 November, held by the municipal and provincial 
leaderships respectively,226 called for the utmost effort to fulfil annual production 
tasks. The reports from these meetings also spoke of a "new leap" in the economy 
for 1975. The People's Daily editorial of 28 November 1974 sounded the swansong 
to the year's political campaign227 and the authorities in Zhejiang immediately 
followed suit.228 On 30 November Mao gave his personal imprimatur to the 
preparations to revive industrial production in 1975 by issuing instructions 
regarding the economy. He thus further consolidated Zhou Enlai and Deng 
Xiaoping's position.229 
      In Zhejiang the campaign had impacted heavily on the economy, the 
industrial sector in particular. Not since 1967 and 1968 had output fallen. 
Industrial output in 1974 declined 13.6% over the previous year and of eighty 
major commodities in the state plan, only eight were fulfilled. Steel output 
dropped 53.5%, pig iron 59%, steel products 46.6%, raw coal 55.5%, cement 32%, 
chemical fertilizer 44%, cotton yam 30%, cotton cloth 27.5% and state revenues fell 
by 24%.230 Political stability was clearly a prerequisite for an improvement on the 
economic front in 1975. 

The Balance-sheet 

      Overall, the three rebel leaders, Zhang Yongsheng, Weng Senhe and He 
Xianchun, could feel highly satisfied with their year's work. Although they had 
failed to topple the provincial leadership, their tactics of destabilization and 
confrontation had rocked it to its foundation. Working from their organizational 
base in the HMWC they had mobilized their supporters in the factories of 
Hangzhou and drafted them into the urban militia which they dominated. 
Simultaneously, they had pressurized the municipal party authorities, in 
coordination with allies who held responsible positions on the CCP HMC, to 
appoint colleagues to important posts in Hangzhou. In the tense and volatile 
atmosphere generated by the anti-Lin anti-Confucius campaign, and taking 
advantage of the opportunities provided by the establishment of the campaign 
small group, the rebel leaders struck at the heart of provincial power, rendering it 
virtually impotent for several months. Encouraged by their perceptions of the 
shifting balance of power in Beijing and protected by national figures such as 
Wang Hongwen, they took advantage of their unique position as both mass 
organization leaders and party members with responsible posts in the party and 
government, to operate both from without and within the institutional 
framework.23l 

      Yet, the radicals also faced a dilemma, as expressed most perceptively by a 
China News Summary comment in late 1975: 

      The representatives of the "rebels" who have been "integrated into 
                                                       RENEWED RADICALISM 173 

     leadership groups" are now in a dilemma. As a minority and without 
     experience they are not decisive in policy-making or personnel 
     appointment. They cannot veto but can only object or delay. When 
     they mobilize their followers in the "masses" to oppose what they have 
     been unable to veto in the leadership groups they are accused of 
     "bourgeois factionalism" and criticized and defeated, even expelled 
     from office. On the other hand some of these "rebels" have come to 
     enjoy being in the "leadership groups" and have developed an attitude 
     of conciliation and co-operation towards their veteran colleagues, 
     tolerating as much as possible and thus losing their "rebel" standpoint. 
     There is no way to prevent them from taking this line, which is 
     "capitulation" in essence, so long as the strength of the entire "rebel" 
     group is weaker than that of the veterans' group. The "ruling group in 
     power" are using "dual" tactics, winning over those "rebels" who are 
     willing to co-operate by giving them fame and position and 
     suppressing by force those who are still unwilling. In a few years’ time 
     the leadership level of the "rebels", laboriously cultivated over the past 
     nine years, may well have "melted away" and the entire endeavor of 
     the Cultural Revolution been lost. Perhaps the most urgent task, in the 
     consideration of those who launched the Cultural Revolution, is to 
     prevent further co-operation between the "rebels" and the veterans. 
     Struggle must be launched particularly against those "rebel" leaders 
      who have been won over or who have capitulated, and now 
      collaborate, so as to split, undermine and even suppress other "rebels" 
      who persist in "rebellion" against the "ruling group in power" and 
      would face annihilation rather than give up.232 

      The rebel leaders in Zhejiang had not been co-opted by the provincial 
leadership but rather forced on it by Wang Hongwen. Wang was no doubt hoping 
that they would eventually be accepted, however unwillingly, by Tan and his 
colleagues. While Weng Senhe and his colleagues made it clear that they were 
hankering after power, acceptance into the system would in a sense curtail their 
freedom. While they remained outsiders to the CCP ZPC they could continue to 
pursue their tactics of political destabilization, which had proved so successful in 
1974. Once absorbed into the system, however, they would be constrained to a 
certain extent by organizational discipline and become captives of its routine and 
bureaucracy. 
      When the radical leaders in Beijing lost the initiative in mid-1974, their 
underlings in Zhejiang could not sustain their assault and were forced to retreat. 
But retreat did not mean submission. The solution to the problems of rebellion, 
factionalism and administrative paralysis in Zhejiang rested with the central 
authorities, but while they were divided over policy direction and split politically, 
no effective initiative was possible. It was Deng Xiaoping who took up the 
challenge of ridding the Chinese political system of what he termed "bourgeois 
factionalism" and the most notorious exponents of confrontational politics in the 
provinces. However, the enormity of the task and the ambivalence of his position 
174 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 forced Deng to make major concessions to his opponents, as chapter nine of this 
 study will reveal. 

 Weng Senhe's Silk Complex: A Model233 

      To conclude this chapter it is instructive to examine briefly the Hangzhou 
 Silk Printing and Dyeing Complex which Weng Senhe built up as a model unit in 
 establishing a militia branch and promoting the "two crashthroughs . The 
 controversies which erupted in the factory as a result of these policies caused 
 massive disruption to production, the consequences of which reverberated across 
 the city. The tensions and divisions which were aggravated amongst the mill's 
 work-force eventually provided the justification for the intervention of the PLA 
 in 1975, if only to guarantee the workers' safety on the shop-floor. 
      Weng used his work unit to set the pace for the "two crashthroughs" and the 
 formation of a new militia outfit.23^ From March to July 1974, 97 employees at the 
 factory were admitted into the CCP and 166 people crash-promoted into leading 
 positions, including ten party members who joined the standing committee of the 
 factory's party committee. Huang Yintang, a close confidant of Weng Senhe and a 
 core member of the "mountain top" faction, became first secretary of the party 
 committee shortly after his admission into the CCP. Huang was also appointed 
 deputy-director of the municipal Public Security Bureau, deputy party secretary of 
 the HMMCH and vice-chairman of the detective office ifr) which was 
 set up jointly by the security bureau and the militia command in April 1974. 
       As Huang's deputy in the silk mill Weng chose a person described as a 
 notorious gambler. He had started work at the factory in 1965 and apparently 
 shared Weng's view that spending one's life performing repetitive, mundane 
 tasks left a lot to be desired. In the Cultural Revolution he participated in raids 
 and assaults with his fellow-workers. In the "two crashthroughs" of 1974 he was 
 admitted into the CCP and, as well as acquiring a party post, became battalion 
 commander (^f-j^jof the militia contingent. He organized a special detachment 
 (5'J^lPA) which carried out nocturnal raids on the houses of workers 
 opposed to Weng's faction. In eight months of 1974, this detachment raided the 
 flats of ten workers. 
       As late as October 1974 Weng and He Xianchun set up a similar detachment 
 in the municipal silk bureau and over the next six months it seized and locked up 
 twenty people and forced them to join a "militia study class".235 Weng personally 
 appointed the party committee first deputy-secretary in the silk bureau. Weng's 
 appointee took charge of the bureau when the secretary was shunted aside in the 
 anti-Lin anti-Confucius campaign. This man's father had reportedly worked for 
 the Guomindang police force and had been responsible for the murder of CCP 
 members. In 1951 he was executed. The son concealed his family history and in 
                                                       RENEWED RADICALISM 175 

the Cultural Revolution joined the rebel forces as having been "oppressed" 
        When the party branch in his unit was reformed in 1969 he joined the 
CCP and became its group leader but the following year was expelled from the 
party for concealing his father's record. In 1974, he joined the Mt. Pingfeng rebels 
and Weng and He Xianchun despatched him to the silk bureau as their "liaison 
man". He rejoined the party in April 1974. Control of the bureau provided Weng 
with another avenue to bypass regulations in admitting new party members.236 
      A third member of Weng's team in the mill, who became known as Weng's 
right-hand man and capable accomplice in crime |X|), was appointed 
deputy-secretary of the party branch in the weaving workshop after joining the 
CCP in 1974. Before the Cultural Revolution he had been disciplined for a 
misdemeanor and sentenced to work on a state farm under supervision. In the 
turmoil of the Cultural Revolution he had stolen his personal file to obtain 
redress for the conviction. Another worker at the silk complex was appointed to 
the Gongshu district "detective" office. He could not wait for the public 
notification of his appointment before rushing off to assume his duties. For good 
measure he also appointed himself deputy-chief of the district public security 
bureau.237 
      Weng Senhe was acutely aware of the fact that the rebels had suffered (o£ 
^5^) in the years 1967-68 because they had not succeeded in obtaining real 
power. The road to power, he realized, was through the CCP. Eighty percent of the 
crash admissions into the party at the mill, and 88% of the crash promotions were 
members of Weng's group. His opponents, by their own admission, used the same 
tactics but were less successful. Weng changed all the heads and their deputies at 
the factory to the workshop levels. Only two out of twenty-two section chiefs 
retained their posts. Twenty-one of his followers were sent out to staff important 
positions in the municipal organization department, the provincial and 
municipal public security bureaux and the silk bureau. Weng boasted that "the 
feudal prime ministers surrounded themselves with high officials; anyone who 
has followed me must get a post, whether it is in a factory, the municipality or the 
province".238 
      Membership of the militia battalion at the silk complex was restricted to 
Weng's supporters. Weng reportedly laid down the rule that no third generation 
worker, party member, or worker who had a perfect attendance record over the 
previous eight years since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution could join. 
Whether these restrictions effectively excluded any applicant is difficult to assess. 
Three released criminals and ten hooligans joined the battalion, as well 
as rebels who had participated in violent clashes in the 1960s. A deputy platoon 
leader named Sun Tianmu was a convicted murderer who was working in the 
factory under supervision. Weng appreciated the fact that his hatred of the system 
176 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

would be strong. Another murderer was appointed a squad leader. Other 
militiamen admitted to the CCP branch at command HQ had unfavorable class 
backgrounds and personal records.23^ 
      The militia at the mill established its own disciplinary group 
which in 1974 seized, beat, locked up and tried in its own kangaroo court 
twenty-three people accused of slandering Weng. Amongst them was a woman 
named Shen Qiying. When Weng Senhe’s power was at its height in the first half 
of 1974 Shen and twenty-six fellow workers mailed a letter to the CCP CC in 
Beijing complaining about his irregular methods of appointment. The letter was 
returned to Zhejiang and the twenty-seven signatories seized. Shen was placed in 
prison for nineteen days while others spent up to eight months in confinement. 
      One of the principal reasons for the level of discontent in factories such as 
the silk complex related to the privileged treatment which was extended to 
members of the militia. For example, one-fifth of the militiamen at the silk 
complex were absent from the production line for extended periods, living 
downtown in the HMMCH building where they performed guard duty or ran 
errands for the militia command's leaders. The remaining militiamen were often 
placed on standby in preparation for an assignment. During the prolonged periods 
of absence from the mill they not only received full pay but extra allowances. One 
day's work for the militia was rewarded with three days' rest. A stint of guard duty 
resulted in overtime pay, while active service was rewarded with free evening 
meals in the factory canteen. Weng further increased the number of non¬ 
productive workers by establishing literary propaganda teams and other cultural 
groups. Workers who remained at their posts were ridiculed as "little lambs”, 
"Confucianists" and "restorationists" and compared unfavorably to the "tigers", 
"Legalists" and "fighters against the tide" who formed the backbone of the militia. 
      It was the resentment and antagonism engendered by this discrimination 
that contributed more to the slump in industrial production than wage demands 
or gripes over poor work facilities. While a sizeable percentage of the work force 
was absent for considerable lengths of time and other workers were threatened or 
harassed on the job, it is little wonder that production plummeted, factional fights 
erupted and personal insecurity increased. The provision of welfare and other 
essential services would also have been affected. The wages of workers who were 
not members of the militia remained unchanged and thus at a comparative 
disadvantage to the wages of their younger, more militant work-mates.

       may have proposed Deng's appointment to this post in December 1973 it appears that he did 
       not actually assume it until January 1975. See Deng Xiaoping Wenxuan, p. 1 fn. Further 
       evidence suggests that while the CC document announced Deng's promotion to the Politburo 
       and membership of the Military Affairs Commission, no mention was made of the position of 
       Chief of Staff. See Jiangsusheng dashiji, p. 325.

          February 1979 recalls the shock that he and other senior officials experienced on hearing 
          these unexpected words of the Chairman's and how they struggled to fathom the 
          implication for the ongoing inner-party struggle.

           said: "I see nothing wrong with posting big-character posters in the streets, and if foreigners 
           want to read them, fine; if the Chinese want to read them, even better". AFP dated the
