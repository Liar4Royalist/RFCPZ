                     FROM "UNITY’ TO RENEWED DISUNITY, 
                           SEPTEMBER 1967-AUGUST 1968 


Steps toward the Three-way Alliance, September-December 1967 

      After the fighting of July to August 1967 the overriding source of instability in 
Zhejiang remained, as it had done since February 1967, the antagonism between 
the two mass organizations. Unity required compromise. Yet United Headquarters 
remained adamant that it would not accept its arch-rival into an alliance unless 
Red Storm accepted a subordinate standing. Red Storm stood equally firm in its 
resolve. Stalemates of this kind were not limited to Zhejiang, and between July 
and September 1967 Mao Zedong visited several provinces in north, central and 
east China to break the logjam. 
      Mao spent one day in Hangzhou on 16 September. Only a very brief excerpt of 
his talk with Nan Ping is available.1 The Chairman objected to the practice of 
forcing cadres to kneel and wear dunce’s-caps and recommended the policy of 
unity-criticism-unity in dealing with them. In a later talk in Jiangxi province Mao 
 predicted that the cadres of Zhejiang, including military officials, would not stand 
 for the continuation of such treatment.2 
      After Mao's return to Beijing, extracts from his directives were compiled and 
 released by the CCP CC.3 The theme of the document was its emphasis on unity. 
 Mao declared that "there was no fundamental conflict of interest within the 
 working class" and therefore no need for it to split into two irreconcilable factions. 
 He attributed the disunity to three factors -- the infiltration of "bad people into 
 mass organizations, the sabotage activities of capitalist-roaders trying to protect 
 themselves, and the influence of anarchist thinking. If both sides strove for 
 common ground on major issues and put minor matters aside, stated the 
 Chairman, unity was possible. But this depended, as Mao realized, on one side 
 abandoning its claim to form the nucleus of the revolutionary great 
 alliance. The day after Mao's visit to Hangzhou, Zhejiang Daily published an 
 editorial repudiating the slogan "I want to be at the core" which United 
 Headquarters had constantly repeated in its pronouncements concerning the 
 alliance.4 The breakthrough cut the ground from under United Headquarters and 
54      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

dealt a savage blow to its ambitions. But all was not lost. Mao's formulations 
regarding unity clearly applied to organizations described as "revolutionary", 
begging the question of whether an organization such as Red Storm qualified. 
     Another issue concerned the status of cadres. Mao believed that the majority 
were good, and that after being allowed the appropriate time to admit and correct 
their past errors, they should be allowed to resume public life. He viewed this 
question as having a crucial bearing on the realization of the three-way alliance of 
mass representatives, cadres and military personnel. The decision directing the 
PLA to take over provincial administrations had been made at a time of social and 
political chaos. Prolonged military rule in the provinces had never been envisaged 
and its continuation was embarrassingly at odds with the overriding objectives of 
the Cultural Revolution. In the meantime, to demonstrate that the military itself 
was not above supervision, Mao suggested the setting-up of study classes for 
military officers. Members of the People's Armed Forces Department, who had 
 directed and led the suppression of the rebels in towns and villages across China, 
 would attend the first such classes. 
      During Mao's tour, agreement was reached on the formation of 
 revolutionary committees in provinces including Zhejiang.5 Yet a long period of 
 difficult and acrimonious discussions bracketed this agreement and the formation 
 of the ZPRC in March 1968. The intervening period witnessed the reemergence of 
 several important civilian cadres from the old provincial and municipal 
 administrations, who provided some leavening of the overwhelming military 
 presence in the province. Problems in the agricultural sector caused by a drought 
 in the autumn of 1967, acted as an additional spur for the recall of experienced 
 civilian administrators. Peasants had diverted their energies from grain 
 production to sideline industries while their immediate leaders, no doubt 
 traumatized by recent events, watched from the sidelines.6 The reappearance of 
 leading cadres encouraged basic-level officials to return to their posts. Political 
 reality and administrative necessity quickly overrode the naive optimism, 
 expressed at the end of October, that "genuine proletarian revolutionaries 
 comprise a majority in reorganized leadership teams at all levels".7 
       Wang Zida, the deputy head of the old CCP HMC and Mayor of Hangzhou 
 was one of the first senior cadres to break with his colleagues and throw in his lot 
 with the new order. On 24 August 1967 he published an article in United 
 Headquarters' newspaper calling Jiang Hua, although not by name, the "biggest 
 royalist in Zhejiang" and proclaimed: "Overthrow XX [Jiang Hua], liberate 
 Zhejiang".8 Furthermore, on 26 August at a televised rally in Hangzhou, Wang 
 confessed his mistakes to an audience composed of "revolutionary masses". Wang 
 had been "liberated" after almost a year or so of harassment.9 Upon the formation 
  of the preparatory committee of the HMRC on 25 October 1967, Wang was named 
                                      FROM "UNITY" TO RENEWED DISUNITY                     55 

its leader and was eventually elected Chairman of the HMRC in December.10 Qiu 
Qiang Deputy-secretary of the CCP HMC before the Cultural 
 Revolution, also reemerged at this time and published a litany of his past errors.11 
      It was not until the end of the year that provincial-level cadres were 
 "liberated". Secretary of the old CCP ZPC, Lai Keke, and a member of its standing 
 committee, Shen Ce, had both come under attack from Red Storm and had 
 therefore been protected by United Headquarters. At the end of November 1967 
 both men published articles expressing support for the Cultural Revolution.12 
 A long-time colleague of Jiang Hua, Wu Xian, was also permitted to join the 
 provisional leadership of the province.13 A leading united front figure and brother 
 of Lu Xun, former Governor Zhou Jianren also reappeared at a rally 
 on December 6,1967, in his capacity as Vice-chairman of the NPC.14 He was 
 undoubtedly trotted out to add respectability and credibility to the new 
 administration. 
       Was there any pattern in the reappearance of former high-ranking officials at 
 this time? Frederick Teiwes has categorized four cadre sub-types who joined 
 provincial revolutionary committees during the Cultural Revolution:15 first, 
  there were members of the old elite who managed to break ties with discredited 
 colleagues; second, those cadres who were outsiders to the particular province in 
 which they served in 1966; third, cadres who had previously been purged;16 and 
  fourth, united front cadres. 
       Lai Keke fits neatly into categories one, two and three and Zhou Jianren into 
  category four. Teiwes suggests that ambition may have driven veteran cadres to 
  break ties of solidarity and climb on board the victorious bandwagon. Wang Zida 
  may certainly slot into this category. He and the head of the CCP HMC, Wang 
  Pingyi, had both served as subordinates to Wu Xian on that body for many years 
  before Wang Pingyi was promoted above Wang Zida in about 1964. The latter 
  Wang may have harbored feelings of resentment and taken advantage of Wang 
  Pingyi's downfall in the Cultural Revolution, to which he in no small way 
  contributed, to seize the top spot in Hangzhou. The case of Wu Xian, however, 
  defies such categorization. The fact that Wu later lost his post on the ZPRC, and 
  was accused of secretly supporting his old chief Jiang Hua, is evidence that other 
  factors were involved. 
        Representatives of mass organizations were another component of the three- 
  in-one alliance. As a pre-condition to selection, they were instructed to form 
  "revolutionary great alliances". Two days after Mao's September stopover in 
  Hangzhou, the unity of four rebel groups at the Hangzhou silk complex was 
  announced.17 Several days later an article written by a representative of each 
  organization, including Weng Senhe on behalf of the Red Rebel Corps, appeared 
  in the Zhejiang Daily.18 Rejecting charges that the alliance was an unprincipled 
56       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

compromise (ft#EX the article detailed the difficulties which had been 
surmounted in achieving unity. The authors also attributed success to the 
"concern" and "assistance" of the provincial military control commission and 
rebel groups in Shanghai and Zhejiang. However, the alliance at the silk mill in 
fact proved to be of short duration. 
      As another means of organizing the rebels into manageable formations, and 
also to break down cross-unit ties, congresses of workers, peasants and Red Guards 
were convened. These congresses in effect became substitutes for the atrophied 
 trade unions, peasant associations and the CYL. Meetings to set up the Zhejiang 
Workers' Congress and congresses of peasants and Red Guards took place over the 
 next few months. As revolutionary committees were set up in various grass-roots 
 units, rallies, conferences and meetings proclaimed the virtue of unity. By late 
 October it was claimed that alliances had been concluded in 90% of Hangzhou's 
 factories and enterprises. The spurious nature of revolutionary committees hastily 
 put together in August 1967 was exemplified by the case of Hangzhou University. 
 It announced an alliance of its two factions, a precondition for electing a 
 revolutionary committee, two months after the committee had in fact been 
 established.19 

 The Formation of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, March 1968 

      Clearly, the Zhejiang provincial leadership was anxious to please its superiors 
 in Beijing by completing arrangements as expeditiously as possible for the 
 formation of the ZPRC. Beginning in September 1967, the various interested 
 parties had held discussions in Beijing under central supervision.20 On 30 
 November the provisional supreme organ of power and United Headquarters 
 convened a rally at which it was declared that "The revolutionary great alliance is 
 being continuously developed and consolidated, and revolutionary leading cadres 
 have already stepped forward". The report boasted that 

       Conditions are fully ripe for establishing the Red political power -- the 
       Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee. To form it as soon as 
       possible is the common aspiration of the 30 million people of the 
       Province.21 

       No alliance was possible without a breakthrough in the negotiations between 
 Red Storm and United Headquarters. In early December 1967 it was Mao Zedong 
 who intervened to push these talks forward. Mao's comments concerning Red 
 Storm formed the basis of the central notice disseminated across the country.22 
 Mao appraised Red Storm thus: 

       The Red Storm of Zhejiang, unlike the Million Warriors of Hubei,23 
       is an old rebel faction which has made mistakes. It has a lot of mass 
       support. It seems that the principle to be adopted toward it is one of 
                                 FROM "UNITY" TO RENEWED DISUNITY               57 

     help, criticism and unity. 

The central document directed that "It is not proper to adopt a policy of exerting 
pressure and imposing absolute exclusion against the masses of such 
organizations". It also admitted realistically that 

      the use of methods such as high pressure, exclusion, power seizure by 
      one faction alone, etc. cannot solve this kind of contradiction. 

 Beijing proposed instead the formation of study classes, made up of members of 
 both factions, taking as their theme the slogan "struggle against self and criticize 
 revisionism" (i|- ^ % )• Criticism would be directed against organizations 
 which had committed mistakes and their members urged to repent. As an 
 inducement, such groups would obtain quotas in revolutionary committees. 
      However, the compromise suggested by Mao probably pleased neither side in 
 Zhejiang. United Headquarters was now forced to negotiate with its hated rival, 
 albeit from a position of moral superiority. Red Storm, on the other hand, had 
 secured endorsement, however qualified, from the great leader himself. This 
 alone was of enormous significance. Most importantly, it had been accredited as a 
 "rebel" organization. Mao's blessing would very likely increase Red Storm's 
 reluctance to discuss or confess its alleged errors. Red Storm had no real 
 alternative but to sit down at the conference table, but it knew full well that its 
 signature was required on an agreement before the establishment of the ZPRC 
 could be announced. Therefore, it had a vested interest in holding out for 
 maximum concessions. 
      In response to this central notice. United Headquarters organized a major 
 rally in Hangzhou on 9 December.24 Zhang Yongsheng, on behalf of United 
 Headquarters, read out Mao's directive and urged compliance. Representatives of 
 Red Storm at Zhejiang University attended the rally and promised to adhere to the 
 terms of the notice. Their spokesman said: 

      We used to fight shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian 
      revolutionaries of the Provincial Revolutionary Rebels' Joint General 
      Command. However, in the storms of the great "January revolution" 
      and at the crucial stage of the revolution, anarchism in our minds 
      asserted itself and was taken advantage of by the party capitalist-roaders. 
      We became separated from Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and 
      committed mistakes of orientation and line. This greatly damaged the 
      Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang. It greatly pains us 
      to think of this and we are ashamed of ourselves. 

      On the same day as the provincial press carried the report of the rally, Weng 
 Senhe and four fellow workers from the silk complex, including Huang Yintang, 
 published an article in which they welcomed Mao's directive and pledged their 
 obedience.25 On 15 December Weng was also a featured speaker at a provincial 
58      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

rally at which he and two colleagues from Red Storm publicly recanted and in 
effect made their desertion official.* In his speech Weng characterized Mao's 
assessment of Red Storm as unfavorable. He stated that Red Storm, despite its 
public confessions, had manipulated Mao's words for its own ends by arguing, that 
everyone, including United Headquarters, had made mistakes. Weng’s denial of 
the allegation that he and his colleagues had joined the revolution (and by 
implication United Headquarters) to gain position, fame and power, 

           was f° carry a very hollow ring, as events later were to prove. 
      At the end of December Weng Senhe was given further publicity with the 
publication of yet another article in Zhejiang Daily .27 Weng was clearly useful as a 
 frontman to convince waverers within the ranks of Red Storm that alliance with 
 United Headquarters, even under unfavorable conditions, was the only viable 
 course open to them. Based largely on his televised speech of the preceding week, 
 Weng’s article encapsulated the predicament facing Red Storm, United 
 Headquarters and the provincial authorities in trying to come to an acceptable 
 compromise on the basis of Mao's 2 December directive. Were Red Storm 
 members to emphasize the phrase which described the organization as an "old 
 rebel faction" (^* or were they to place stress on the phrase "which has 
 committed mistakes" (J2,li4a Were Red Storm's errors minor or 
 were they mistakes of line, and how did they compare with those committed by 
 United Headquarters? Was emphasis in forthcoming negotiations to be placed on 
 the alliance G^'a’) or on "help and criticism" (^? Related to but 
 more important than all these considerations was the quota (-^ f|) to be 
 reserved for Red Storm on revolutionary committees. 
       Weng argued that since February 1967, when it had wrecked the rally held by 
 United Headquarters to denounce Jiang Hua, Red Storm had committed mistakes 
 of an ultra-left nature. By its splittist, destabilizing activities and by attacking 
 United Headquarters, it had allowed the rightists (the provincial capitalist-roaders) 
 to cause more trouble. Some of its members, complained Weng, even refused to 
 heed the center's 2 December directive. 
       In a conciliatory gesture Zhejiang Daily began to differentiate between Red 
 Storm and conservative or reactionary organizations.28 However, it accused "the 
  old rebel faction which has committed mistakes" of "petty-bourgeois fanaticism". 
  In a talk he gave early in 1968 Zhou Enlai described Red Storm as "a bit too far to 
  the 'Left'".29 Perhaps the description related to Red Storms' popularity among 
  students and teachers in Hangzhou, groups notorious for the fanaticism of their 
  behavior in the Cultural Revolution. The editorial also warned that "rightists" 
  would seek to take advantage of the atmosphere of reconciliation to cause trouble. 
  Among them were a sizeable proportion of Red Storm members who were 
                                     FROM "UNITY" TO RENEWED DISUNITY                      59 

unhappy at the prospect of kowtowing to United Headquarters. 
      From 29 November until 6 December, during which time Mao's comments 
about Red Storm were made public, a conference jointly sponsored by United 
Headquarters and the ZPRC preparatory committee took place.30 Chen Liyun, 
Political Commissar of Unit 7350, delivered the major address. He claimed 
 optimistically that the situation in Zhejiang was excellent: United Headquarters 
 had acquired a high prestige and a considerable number of cadres were resuming 
 work. Personal grudges should not determine which cadres were "liberated", he 
 reminded his listeners. Chen emphasized that political power was the key 
 question and the establishment of the ZPRC was "imminent". The shortcomings 
 evident in the provisional organ of power -- presumably the absence of Red Storm 
 representatives - would "gradually be corrected", he promised. Zhang Yongsheng 
 delivered a report summing up the year's events in Zhejiang. 
       Despite the sanctity surrounding Mao's directives and the undoubted 
 pressures from Beijing, the road towards unity was a minefield of grudges and 
 jealousies which threatened progress all the way. The desire by both groups to 
 form the nucleus of the alliance was obviously strong, as an editorial of Zhejiang 
 Daily observed: 

       Why can they not overcome their own mountain-stronghold 
       mentality or give up their own contingent (?&<£? if jtfc 1$ 
                  Some of them even dream of returning to their own. 
       stronghold, of commanding their own contingent and of starting civil 
       war" again....31 

 If political power was the issue, as Chen Liyun had stated, then both groups hoped 
  to get their share in the distribution of quotas to mass representatives for seats on 
  revolutionary committees. 
       Another sensitive issue concerned divisions within the military and its 
  relations with the two mass organizations. A Zhejiang Daily editorial of mid 
  December 1967 complained that "some people" ignored the opinions of the 
  military about the composition of the ZPRC.32 These people, who were not 
  named, thought only of their own interests and fame, and believed that they could 
  flex their muscles to intimidate others. Such behavior, warned Zhejiang Daily, 
  would lead to their downfall, no matter how great their capabilities or past 
  achievements. It is difficult to know at which faction this stern warning was 
  directed, but it may well have been at certain members of Red Storm, who were 
  refusing to concede to United Headquarters its claim for greater representation on 

  the ZPRC. 
        Whether the military in Zhejiang held a unified view towards the two major 
  mass organizations is debatable. Unit 7350 had shown a decided and open partiality 
  for United Headquarters,33 a position not shared as blatantly by the 20th Army. Yet 
60      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

in late October 1967, the Air Force unit held a meeting at which harsh words were 
expressed about the behavior of the rebels, presumably those from United 
Headquarters. They were rebuked for indulging in sectarianism and stressing the 
"core" mentality. The Air Force unit had held study classes to maintain close 
contacts with and "train” the rebel leaders 34 Thus, even Unit 7350 was conscious 
of creating the impression that it exercised its authority as a central "support the 
left" unit without favor. 
      Leaders of naval and army units attended the meeting to extend 
congratulations to the Air Force for its contributions in the Cultural Revolution. 
Xie Zhenghao (igt jE'JUr), Commander of the Naval units,35 commended Unit 
7350 for its firm support for the proletarian revolutionaries. Political Commissar 
Nan Ping of Unit 6409 went even further in stating that the Air Force had proved 
itself the most resolute in the work of "three supports and two militaries". This 
display of inter-service harmony and back-slapping was in reality a facade for the 
latent tensions between the units which was reflected in other reports. One such 
 report accused the capitalist-roaders of spreading rumors designed to weaken unity 
between different units of the military and between the PLA and the citizenry. 
 Another report, summarizing an article from Liberation Army Daily in Beijing, 
 concerned a small unit, probably of the 20th Army. It had chosen the wrong side 
 among two factions on a commune, due to the influence of "old thoughts and 
 conventions".36 
      One expert contends that political friction between Units 7350 and 6409 served 
 as a proxy for the battle between the two mass organizations.37 The hostility 
 between United Headquarters and Red Storm had shaken the unity of the PLA 
 units in Zhejiang. Mistrust between the military and the mass organizations added 
 to the tension. As the new year of 1968 commenced, however, greater efforts were 
 made to overcome disunity and agree upon the conditions for the establishment 
 of the ZPRC. To attain this objective, the central authorities summoned military 
 leaders to Beijing for discussions and study. They also held representatives of the 
 mass organizations under virtual confinement in the capital until they could 
 reach an agreement.38 On 16 February 1968, this approach paid dividends when, 
 amidst great rejoicing, the alliance was signed. The majority of the leaders of Red 
 Storm had stuck to their guns and not defected with Weng Senhe. They had 
 signed the agreement with United Headquarters as equal partners and expected to 
 share the spoils which had been promised to both organizations. 
       The theme of central and provincial propaganda at the beginning of 1968 
 focused on the evils of factionalism and highlighted the need for unity. To 
 demonstrate their neutrality and evenhandedness PLA units were ordered to 
 "support the left, not any faction" (—of the two major 
 groups.39 From 14 to 25 January, Unit 6409 held a conference to discuss the 
                                      FROM "UNITY" TO RENEWED DISUNITY                     61 

implications of the new policy direction while units 6409 and 7350 published two 
 articles on the theme of supporting the left and not any faction.40 Zhejiang Daily 
 also republished from Red Storm's newspaper an editorial opposing factionalism 
 as well as an article by United Headquarters expressing similar sentiments.41 As an 
 example to the rest of Zhejiang, Nan Ping and Chen Liyun co-authored an article 
 in People's Daily praising the deeds of a Li Wenzhong, a national model in 
 implementing the new course.42 For its part Zhejiang Daily released a series of ten 
 editorials between 4 January and 22 February, entitled "Down with factionalism" 

 (tT«i£)43 
       The general thrust of the editorials was that the question of power unduly 
 preoccupied the minds of the two factions. Given the direction that the Cultural 
 Revolution had taken since the beginning of 1967 the authorities had little reason 
 to be surprised at this obsession with power. The rebels had risen against the old 
 party authorities after Mao had issued the call to arms. They had fought each other 
 and the military back and forth across the province for twelve months. Now, 
 when all the pieces were being put back together it was rather late in the day for 
  Zhejiang Daily to expect them to renounce all reward for their labors. From their 
  sudden and fierce initiation into the arena of elite political struggle, they had very 
  quickly learned that obtaining and holding onto power outweighed all other 
  considerations. 
       With negotiations under way and positions on revolutionary committees 
  and the three congresses (worker, peasant and Red Guard) up for grabs, 
  compromise would lead to defeat. The editorials admitted that both sides strove to 
  maximize the number, position and seniority of their representatives in the new 
  power structure. As the basis for their respective claims, both factions argued over 
  which group had played the major role in the Cultural Revolution. If this 
  disputation continued, warned one editorial rising to new heights of hyperbole, 
  the disgraced party authorities would instigate civil war and in the resultant 
  confusion infiltrate the ranks of the revolutionaries and regain power. 
        According to one editorial, members of Red Storm had become "so arrogant 
  and conceited that they even have refused to admit their mistakes" and put on 
  airs of self-styled old rebels and genuine revolutionaries". Zhejiang Daily 
  accurately predicted that if Red Storm walked away from the talks dissatisfied, it 
  would not afford recognition to the ZPRC and would instead work for its 
  overthrow. This was why both groups took a "pragmatic attitude" towards central 
  instructions. They complied with those that suited them and boycotted those that 
  did not. The question of cadres was one case in point. It was obviously in the 
  interests of both Red Storm and United Headquarters that only those cadres with 
  whom they could cooperate on revolutionary committees be allowed to reappear 
  on the political stage. This important consideration certainly contributed to the 
62      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

footdragging in implementing central policy. The return of each cadre was thus a 
slow process and the result of protracted negotiation. 
     Wu Xian was one leading cadre who seems to have been opposed by United 
Headquarters but who had been permitted to join the new provisional hierarchy. 
At a mass rally held on 19 January 1968, Wu delivered a report on factionalism.44 
He stated that it was necessary to distinguish between factional disputes and the 
struggle between the two lines. Wu's words reflected a fear on the part of the 
authorities that a blanket denunciation of factionalism could imply that the 
supposedly genuine and principled differences between the revolutionary and 
revisionist lines fell into the category of factional disputes. Whether Wu's 
listeners grasped the distinction is another matter. The struggle for power had 
become the major issue at stake and for the members of both mass organizations 
its successful outcome would compensate for the sacrifices and hardships of the 
previous twelve months. 
      On 7 February 1968, the Provincial Revolutionary Rebel Joint General 
Committee convened a rally to attack factionalism.45 This body comprised leading 
members of both United Headquarter and Red Storm. Eleven days later, on 16 
February, an editorial in Zhejiang Daily proclaimed the signing of the agreement 
between the two mass organizations in Beijing.46 A Hong Kong observer claimed 
that the two organizations had signed a twelve-point agreement in January 1968, 
but that "the local branches paid no heed and went on with their angry 
squabbles".47 Two documents were signed in February. One concerned the alliance 
of United Headquarters and Red Storm and the other related to the alliance at 
Zhejiang University, bastion of Red Storm.48 The editorial admitted that only 
central intervention had brought the groups to the conference table. Ruing the fact 
that "strife for supremacy has brought us misery", Zhejiang Daily urged each side 
to refrain from statements and actions detrimental to what was clearly a fragile 
agreement. To press home the importance of unity, the editorial also warned 
against the sabotage activities of Guomindang agents, while at the same time 
declaring optimistically that "from now on the road is smooth". 
      That the road was anything but smooth quickly became apparent. Within 
days of the announcement Zhejiang Daily acknowledged that "Some people have 
even engaged in factionalism after being united" or were preparing for "civil 
war".49 A further editorial divulged the news that a feature of factionalism which 
had emerged in the aftermath of the signing of the agreement was that those who 
promoted unity were being maligned as revisionists.50 Debates were undoubtedly 
raging within both Red Storm and United Headquarters about what they had 
gained and what they had sacrificed by the agreement. The controversy forced the 
HMRC to issue an urgent notice on 29 February 1968 demanding adherence to the 
 agreement from all sides.51 
                                           FROM "UNITY" TO RENEWED DISUNITY                              63 

      The two organizations delayed celebrating the alliance until 1 March.52 
Mutual suspicion was rife. An editorial in Zhejiang Daily referred to the attempt 
by sides to try and build up their numbers, demands for the agreement's revision 
or the inclusion of supplementary articles and secret meetings and recruitment 
drives in the countryside. They were informed bluntly that they must accept the 
document "even if they did not understand the reason for ... restrictions 
contained in it.53 Representatives of both organizations in the counties were 
brought to Hangzhou to attend study classes.54 Dissatisfied members of Red Storm 
branded upholders of the agreement from their side as "Right deviates who want 
to become officials". Those members of United Headquarters who preferred 
confrontation to consensus argued sarcastically that "The worst thing that could 
happen to us in this struggle is to have ourselves end up as veteran rebels who 
have made mistakes" 55 Thus, they openly voiced their dissatisfaction at Mao's 

 partial rehabilitation of Red Storm. 
       Despite the possibility that the agreement between United Headquarters and 
 Red Storm could break down at any moment, the central authorities pushed on 
 with their plans to set up the ZPRC, obviously believing that any agreement was 
 better than none. In a speech on 2 February 1968, Zhou Enlai stated that Beijing 
 hoped to establish the ZPRC in February 1968 56 Even by mid-March, only one 
 municipality and sixteen counties in the province had formed revolutionary 
 committees57 Finally, on the night of 18 March, a delegation from Zhejiang 
 consisting overwhelmingly of military officials met central leaders to report on the 
 successful outcome of the protracted, supervised negotiations which had been held 

 in Beijing.58 
        The head of the Cultural Revolution Group, Chen Boda, chaired the meeting 
 and made the concluding speech. Other speakers included Zhou Enlai, Jiang Qing, 
 Kang Sheng and Xu Shiyou, Commander of the Nanjing Military Region and a 
  staunch supporter of Red Storm. The leaders of Red Storm and United 
  Headquarters, Fang Jianwen and Zhang Yongsheng, made verbal pledges on behalf 
  of their respective organizations. Zhou Enlai claimed that the impetus behind the 
  negotiations had come from the center and from Mao in particular. Of all the 
  central leaders Zhou alone appeared familiar with the details of the situation in 

  Zhejiang. 
         The Premier was critical of the PLA's tendency to interfere in matters that 
  were best left to others to settle. He mentioned the past mistakes of the ZPMD, and 
  of individual members of the military control commission, and pointedly referred 
  to the study classes which had been held to educate the military on the desirability 
  of adopting a neutral stand toward both factions.5* In his brief talk Xu Shiyou also 
  raised the issue of PLA neutrality toward the mass organizations. Zhou declared 
  that finalization of the membership of the ZPRC entailed the dissolution of the 
64        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

two mass organizations.60 He stated that the only two factions which remained 
were the proletarian revolutionaries and the bourgeois or petty-bourgeois 
factionalists. He ordered the closure of liaison stations maintained by Red Storm 
and United Headquarters in the counties of Zhejiang and in major urban centers 
outside the province. His unambiguous message was that local groups would 

solve their problems without outside interference. 
       In line with Mao's pronouncement that the Cultural Revolution represented 
a continuation of the class struggle between the CCP and Chiang Kaishek s 
Guomindang, Zhou pointed out the strategic importance of Zhejiang to the 
 success of the Revolution. Chen Boda charged the "capitalist-roaders" of Zhejiang 
 with being Guomindang agents 61 Kang Sheng, in the conspiratorial style he had 
 perfected, labored this fact, urging the rebels to be on the lookout for Guomindang 
 agents.62 Provincial propaganda later elaborated on Kang's warnings ad 

 nauseam.63 
       However, these issues were of secondary importance compared to the major 
 problem which had exercised the minds of those present for months - the 
 composition of the ZPRC. Zhou Enlai announced that it would comprise 94 
 members, 50 of whom would come from Hangzhou. Red Storm would nominate 
 ten representatives to the committee and would have three members on its 
 standing committee. Zhou stated that one Vice-chairman would come from the 
 ranks of the workers. He added that the final make-up of the committee had not 
 been decided upon and joint investigation would enable cadres to be added in a 
 "principled way" to achieve "gradual perfection". 
        On 19 March the Zhejiang delegation was welcomed back to the province 
 with a rally in Hangzhou,64 but in the six days that transpired between the Beijing 
 meeting and the 24 March rally celebrating the formation of the ZPRC, the 
 agreement to include representatives of Red Storm on the revolutionary 
 committee collapsed. Unfortunately, no list of the full membership of the ZPRC is 
 available. The composition of the fifteen-member standing committee included 
 eight military representatives, five cadres and only two mass representatives, both 
 from United Headquarters. The ZPRC has been classified it as a revolutionary 
  committee "practically created by ... other military units" and Zhejiang as a 
  province where the revolutionary committee was formed only "after new 
  commanders ... had been appointed who enjoyed the support of the Central 
  Authorities ,..".65 Red Storm was represented neither on the standing committee 
  nor, most probably, on the ZPRC itself. It is little wonder then that it felt betrayed 
  by the failure to honor the agreement signed before central leaders. The 
  organization henceforth embarked on a campaign of opposition to show that 
  Zhejiang could not regain any semblance of stability without its participation in 
  the new political structure. 
                                           FROM "UNITY" TO RENEWED DISUNITY                              65 

      United Headquarters fared little better. Zhang Yongsheng was elected a Vice- 
chairman of the ZPRC although he did not appear at the inaugural rally. Perhaps 
he boycotted it from dissatisfaction with the limited number of places reserved for 
his organization. Zhang's first appearance as Vice-chairman of the ZPRC seems to 
have occurred on 17 April 1968.66 The other mass representative was Hua Yinfeng, 
a child-bride and national labor model from a state pig farm in Jinhua District. She 
was also elected a Vice-chairman of the ZPRC. Hua was probably an example of a 
rebel who have been characterized as more conservative, more attuned to working 
with established authority, and better able to adjust to the process of rebuilding the 

political system, than other rebels.67

  Further Instability and Violence, March - August 1968 

        The dismissal of PLA acting Chief of Staff Yang Chengwu, announced by Lin 
  Biao in March 1968, ushered in a renewed period of leftist militancy across 
66        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

China.68 A Zhejiang Daily editorial published on the day of the formation of ZPRC 
set the tone for the more radical phase of the following months. While a 
 succession of editorials and speeches criticized factionalism, these differed 
 markedly in nature and intent from those published in January and February 1968. 
 This previous period was now redefined as the 1968 "Spring Current”, and was 
 described as having its roots in the 1967 "February Countercurrent . It was 
 considered that the previous emphasis on unity had been excessive and that a 
 radical upsurge was required to maintain the momentum of the Cultural 
 Revolution. Written and verbal broadsides were directed against attempts by the 
 former power-holders to obtain admission to the newly-established revolutionary 
 committees and Red Storm's denigration of and opposition to the ZPRC. Such a 
 media onslaught further inflamed factional tensions. Any hope held by the 
 authorities that Red Storm would meekly accept its omission from the ZPRC and 
 other representative bodies was soon dashed. The two factions fought it out, wrote 
 the Zhejiang Daily, while the capitalist-roaders looked on with satisfaction. The 
 class enemy had begun infiltrating the revolutionary committees by using 
 revolutionary slogans or instead maligned them as "committees of factions”.69 
       To divert the rebels from their endless squabbles the 1st plenum of the ZPRC, 
 which met from 25 to 31 March,70 mapped out a strategy to destroy Tan Zhenlin's 
 reputation in Zhejiang. The strategy had been devised in Beijing71 and its 
 objective was to condemn Tan for his alleged responsibility in plotting the 
 February 1967 Countercurrent. Because of Tan's close connections with Zhejiang 
 and the old CCP ZPC, this approach had the added attraction of making Jiang Hua 
 a prime target. Rallies which were held in April 1968 put the plan into action.72 On 
 4 April, the day of the first rally, an editorial published in Zhejiang Daily entitled 
 "Resolutely overthrow the number one Party person in authority in Zhejiang 
 taking the capitalist road" blamed Jiang and his associates for the state of disunity 
 among the rebels. It pointed out that 

       In attacking the handful of capitalist-roaders in Zhejiang the 
       revolutionary masses should immediately stop the struggle among 
       themselves and unite as one to chop off the sinister hands and smash 
       the sinister line. 

       A principal target at the rallies was one of Jiang's closest former subordinates, 
 Xue Ju. Xue was blamed for spreading the rumor that Jiang Hua was a member of 
 Chairman Mao's Headquarters and disseminating articles in praise of his boss and 
 other former leaders of the province. As argued in chapter one of this study, Xue 
 had sound reasons for describing Jiang in this way, particularly with the official 
 silence from Beijing concerning Jiang's status. On 15 April Red Storm was one of 
 the convenors of a large rally, an indication that efforts to keep it in the political 
 mainstream continued. A former Secretary of the ZPC secretariat, Lai Keke, in his 
                                            FROM "UNITY" TO RENEWED DISUNITY                              67 

summation speech at the rally, demanded the exposure of all capitalist-roaders in 
Zhejiang. 
       In April Zhejiang Daily published five editorials devoted to discrediting the 
old provincial administration and propagating the revised definition of 
factionalism.73 The general thrust of the editorials was synthesized in a People's 
 Daily and Liberation Army Daily joint editorial defending proletarian 
 factionalism. A Red Flag commentary entitled "Factionalism must be subjected to 
 class analysis", most probably written by Chen Boda, was the most authoritative 
 statement of the position.74 Rather than subjecting factionalism as such to 
 criticism, these polemics limited their attacks to "bourgeois factionalism". The 
 disagreements between mass organizations of early 1968, which at the time had 
 been described as factional squabbles, were retrospectively reinterpreted as 
 principled political struggles. 
        One observer has described Chen Boda's commentary as an effort by the 
 Maoists to define a new class theory.75 Instead of the old definition, which tended 
 to view class in terms of social origin, this incipient approach based class on 
 behavior and attitude. The origins of Chen's thesis may be traced to the previous 
 year. On 9 August 1967, Lin Biao had issued an instruction on the Cultural 
 Revolution which stated in part that 

        As a basis for delineating Leftists and Rightists you should take 
        whether they support or oppose this Great Cultural Revolution 
        launched by Chairman Mao himself, and whether they defend or 
        oppose Chairman Mao. You should stand firmly beside Chairman Mao, 
        stand beside the Leftists, and stand beside the masses. You should not 
        consider merely whether class origins are pure of [sic] whether Party 
        members or cadres are numerous when you divide people into Leftists 
        and Rightists or when you look at problems. Class origins should be 
        looked at, of course, but you should not only look at class origins; the 
        most important thing is to realize on what party line these people 
        stand.76 

        By the logic of this argument, those who supported Mao automatically 
 became proletarian revolutionaries; those who opposed him were bourgeois 
 reactionaries. The approach circumvented accusations of class impurity which had 
 been levelled against certain mass organizations by party officials under attack 77 In 
 his article, Chen Boda quoted Mao as having stated, "there are parties outside the 
 Party and factions within it; this has always been the case" fa 
 W ^-.95^iDlit)-78 These words provided authority for Chen's thesis that 
 the existence of factions was inevitable in class society and that classes and factions 
 were somehow intertwined, factional struggle being a manifestation of class 
 struggle. While Chen’s view of the universal nature of factionalism within the 
 CCP may have reflected an accurate and frank assessment of reality,79 it was an 
68       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

opinion decidedly at odds with the party’s public pronouncements on the issue. 
Mao himself eventually drew back from the implications of this analysis. For 
example, in April 1968, he characterized the Cultural Revolution as a 
"continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie .80 
The lack of theoretical clarity underlying the vague notion of continuous 
revolution", with its undeveloped and inconsistent notions of classes and class 
struggle under socialism, occasioned and implicitly justified such tactical shifts.81 
The blurring of the dividing line between factional and class enemies would lead 
to harsh measures against rebels when the campaign to purify the class ranks 

(vtSMPAlfi) was initiated in 1968.82 
       In Zhejiang, the revised definition of factionalism was propagated in an 
editorial of 21 April.83 Furthermore, an article of 5 May quoted Mao to the effect 
that "a faction is the wing of a class" ($[£#J W“S-)-84 Theory was being 
 used instrumentally to fit the requirements of political debate and factional struggle. 
On the basis of this ideological innovation, opponents of the ZPRC were classified 
 as class enemies. In some areas, admitted Zhejiang Daily, power had remained in 
 the hands of party officials.83 Unnamed evil leaders were actively falsifying 
 documents and spreading rumors aimed at discrediting the PLA and the ZPRC. 
       One editorial seemed to indicate that United Headquarters had gone almost 
 completely onto the defensive. Leaders of mass organizations such as Red Storm 
 and the Wenzhou Rebel General HQ were accusing the members of United 
 Headquarters of being "rightists engaged in subversion". So much for the threat 
 issued by party leaders such as Zhou Enlai that mass organizations would be 
 dissolved after the establishment of revolutionary committees. The editorial noted 
 that officials who had joined the new power structure were accused of being 
 "rightists masquerading as leftists”.86 A commentator from Hong Kong 
 perceptively remarked at the time that Zhejiang "seemed to be defending the 
 'rebels' against 'conservatives'". Commenting on reports from Zhejiang in June 
 the writer observed: "one would have thought that the authorities were on the 
 side of the revolutionaries and were afraid of a revival of the conservatives".87 
 This trend had been apparent as early as April 1968. 
        From 9 to 31 May 1968 the ZPRC held a lengthy conference of CCP members, 
 effectively excluding from participation most of the mass organization leaders, 
 who were not members of the party.88 The conference attempted to effect a 
 reconciliation between Red Storm and United Headquarters by issuing advice to 
 both groups. It counselled the former organization thus: "Revolutionary mass 
 organizations that have taken the wrong side must handle their own mistakes 
 correctly". To United Headquarters it enjoined it to treat its rival correctly. Only in 
 this way, stressed the conference, could an alliance be formed.89 These words 
  indicated, if nothing else, the total breakdown of the agreement signed in 
                                            FROM "UNITY" TO RENEWED DISUNITY                              69 

February, made worthless by events since March and justified by the revised 
definition of factionalism propagated in April. 
       Yet intermittent gestures toward the unity of the mass organizations were 
evident. On 26 May 1968, in an unprecedented show of unity, Zhejiang Daily and 
Hangzhou Daily published a joint editorial together with Red Storm's newspaper, 
 "Red Storm", the "Zhejiang Red Guard" ($ff and the "Hangzhou 
Worker" I A)- The editorial seemed optimistic about the prospects for 
 unity and declared that the struggle to achieve victory in the Cultural Revolution 
 was approaching a climax.90 In a further conciliatory gesture, Zhejiang Daily 
 republished an article originally carried in "Red Storm".91 
       Reconciliation of the two mass organizations was accompanied by further 
 rehabilitation of cadres. An editorial in mid-May repeated Mao's injunction that 
 90% of cadres were good or comparatively good and stated that those "liberated" by 
 the proletarian revolutionaries formed the core and backbone of revolutionary 
 committees. The editorial urged vigilance against cadres who tried to pass 
 themselves off, in words taken from Mao's description of Red Storm as 
 "revolutionary cadres who have committed mistakes".92 
        In late May, the Zhejiang authorities taking their cue from Jiang Qing who at 
 the end of March had vilified Tan Zhenlin as a traitor,93 organized the resumption 
 of rallies to denounce Tan by name.94 These were followed by intensified public 
 attacks on Jiang Hua and his supporters.95 On 19 May, Jiang Qing along with Chen 
 Boda, Yao Wenyuan and Jiang and Mao’s daughter Xiao Li, received Zhang 
 Yongsheng and Du Yingxin in Beijing. Zhang and Du reported on the campaign to 
 "purify class ranks" at their fine arts college. In her talk Jiang attacked Tan and 
 Jiang Hua and encouraged Zhang to take the lead in publicly denouncing them. 
 On 11 June, Zhang reported the conversation to Wang Hongwen in Shanghai.96 
 United Headquarters clearly hoped that by linking Jiang with Tan, it could 
 demonstrate Red Storm's responsibility for the instability and violence which had 
 plagued Zhejiang since February 1967. Denunciation of Tan would pave the way. 
 An editorial of 27 June day readers that Jiang Hua had worked in the province 
 since liberation and his influence and power were not easily eradicated. In an 
 attempt to intimidate sceptics Zhejiang Daily warned them not to underestimate 

 Jiang: 

        We absolutely cannot consider Zhejiang's number one capitalist-roader 
        a "dead tiger". This fellow has only been "wounded", not killed. His 
        fangs and claws are still dangerous. He is testing the wind and waiting 
        for an opportune moment to pounce on the revolutionary masses.

70        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

An editorial of the following day warned Red Storm indirectly that it too would 
suffer if the capitalist-roaders remounted Zhejiang's political stage. 
       Evidence of organized opposition to the new provincial administration had 
emerged to give some substance to Zhejiang Daily's hysterical outbursts. A report 
published over a year later attributed responsibility for this opposition to Fang 
Jianwen, one of the leaders of Red Storm.98 In June 1968, cadres sympathetic to 
Red Storm working in departments of the old CCP ZPC and HMC pasted up wall 
posters attacking the provincial leadership. One particular poster, entitled Arise 
 and charge into the storm", openly advocated a bloody struggle against the new 
 provincial hierarchy.99 Factional fighting in the factories of Hangzhou flared up 
 again. Members of United Headquarters at the Hangzhou Silk Complex reportedly 
 started a fire in the mill's boiler-room on 9 July 1968 causing damage estimated at 
 20,000 yuan and injuring several people.100 
       Even more worrying for the new leadership of Zhejiang was an open letter, 
 published on 6 July, denigrating the ZPRC, the PLA and, by implication, Mao 
 Zedong. Zhejiang Daily later published an article quoting extensively from the 
 letter.101 It apparently made three major points, all unflattering, about the nature 
 of political power in Zhejiang. First, it alleged that "The power of the provincial 
 revolutionary committee is usurped by counterrevolutionary double-dealers". The 
 letter referred to the members of the three-way alliance -- cadres, mass 
 representatives and PLA — respectively as "true capitalist-roaders", "clowns" and 
 "pawns", and "counter-revolutionary double-dealers". The oppositionists 
 described the ZPRC as an "illegal faction committee" which they would smash so 
 as to become "masters of the Zhejiang political stage". In the meantime they 
 refused to recognize, support or join the revolutionary committee. The authors of 
 the Zhejiang Daily article distinguished this approach from that adopted by 
 members of Red Storm who, it claimed, "have a deep feeling they wield power 
 and have become masters" A)- 
        Finally, the letter accused the authorities of exercising "bourgeois 
 dictatorship" and substituting coercion for extensive democracy. It described the 
 attitude taken toward Red Storm as "suppression of the old rebels and the masses 
 of the people". Apart from claiming that central directives were responsible for the 
 "suppression of the masses", the letter-writers expressed support for opponents of 
 the ZPRC who were put on trial in August 1968. They also proclaimed, in relation 
 to further trouble which had erupted in Wenzhou, that "South Zhejiang is the 
 world of the Rebel General HQ". While the letter certainly reflected the opinions 
 and feelings of opponents of United Headquarters, Zhejiang Daily excused Red 
 Storm from sharing its sentiments. However, this charitable interpretation may 
 have been dictated more by political expediency than by respect for the truth. 
                                           FROM "UNITY" TO RENEWED DISUNITY                               71 

       Other critics attacked the ZPRC from the left putting forward such slogans as 
"election by the whole people", and demanding the smashing of state organs. They 
maligned the revolutionary committees as committees of the Guomindang.102 
The attacks, and the way in which they were phrased, seem to owe their rhetoric to 
the program of the Hunan ultra-leftist group Shengwulian ^C®)-103 
       The events which occurred in the immediate aftermath of the establishment 
of the ZPRC proved that both United Headquarters and Red Storm lacked 
commitment to the agreement imposed on them in February 1968. The alliance 
was uneasy and fragile and liable to degenerate into open conflict at the slightest 
provocation. The establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee had 
raised as many questions as it was supposed to solve. While a civilian 
administration of sorts had finally replaced direct military rule in Zhejiang, the 
new political authority remained under PLA domination. It was racked by internal 
discord and constantly threatened by political players who, through either 
preference or necessity, stayed outside the political mainstream. When verbal 
abuse and other provocations were supplemented by armed challenges to the new 
committees, the military was again forced to intercede and come down very hard 
on the instigators.
