Crackdown, August-September 1968 

       In July 1968, Beijing ordered the military in Zhejiang to crack down on 
 disorder. On " and 24 July the central authorities issued two notices to quell 
 disturbance^ in the Guangxi Autonomous Region and Shaanxi province 
 respectively.1 However, the message had national relevance. The notices denounced 
 disruption to railway traffic, storming of PLA units and clashes with soldiers 
 perpetrated by Red Guards and revolutionary rebels. Those responsible were called 
 counter-revolutionaries and the military was instructed to spare no effort in 
 suppressing them. Other anarchic activities included the looting of state property, 
 the burning down of public and private buildings, refusal to comply with central 
 directives, broadcasts by unauthorized radio stations and raids on state prisons and 
 labour farms to release inmates. In a meeting with Red Guard leaders on 28 July Mao 
 expressed disillusionment with their performance.2 An editorial of People's Daily in 
 early August attacked the "theory of many centers" (ffr 311(1 demanded 
 obedience to central discipline and disavowal of anarchistic or individualistic 

 tendencies.3 
        It was at the second enlarged plenum of the ZPRC, held from 17 to 29 July, that 
 major decisions concerning Wenzhou (see below) and summing up the Cultural 
 Revolution in the province were made.4 Two hundred and forty delegates attended, 
 including members of the HMRC and responsible personnel from counties and 
 major industrial units and colleges across the province. Surprisingly, the meeting 
 expressed optimism about the situation in Zhejiang after its examination of the 
 performance of the ZPRC. A five-point resolution encapsulated the decisions taken 
 by the plenum. 
        The first resolution stated that the meeting "voiced constructive criticism" of 
  the failings of the ZPRC leadership and "strong criticism of and willingness to help 
  members of the Revolutionary Committee who diverged from Mao Zedong's 
  Thought". Another resolution, by contrast, repudiated those who had expressed 
  pessimistic views about the state of affairs in Zhejiang. Resolution four demanded 
  that both mass organizations desist from mutual provocation and expel bad 
                                                                           ORDER AND UNITY 73 

elements from their ranks as a precondition to forming an alliance. Torturing of 
political opponents was forbidden, as was interference in the internal affairs of the 
PLA. The resolution concluded with a ringing cry for victory in the Cultural 
Revolution. It was clear that Beijing expected positive action to this end. The luxury 
of endless debate and interminable disputes over the finer points of right and wrong 
was no longer to be enjoyed by mass organizations. They would conform or face the 
consequences. 
       The show of force by the military in southern Zhejiang was backed up by a 
series of trials which began in August 1968.5 Their purpose was to impose harsh 
sentences on anti-sodal elements who had taken advantage of the prevailing 
lawlessness to commit various kinds of criminal acts. The trials also dealt with 
trouble-makers of a political kind who had worked to undermine the new power 
structure and refused to accept its authority. In particular, those people who persisted 
in provoking factional struggles were severely punished. Propaganda teams made 
up of soldiers, cadres, peasants and workers were sent into major educational 
institutions to pacify the students. The youthful proletarian revolutionaries had 
little option but to accept their fate. 
       The most sensational trial was that of Nie Minzhi Xia 
Liangchang (J[ $Â£.$%) and Peng Zhangxun Jl|).6 Peng was a PLA soldier 
who was described as having a "dubious" family background, Nie a cadre, and Xia 
was referred to as a swindler, extortionist and rapist. They had apparently caused a 
great deal of trouble over the previous two years. In the autumn of 1967 the trio had 
joined with unspecified mass organizations -- most probably Red Storm and 
Wenzhou's Rebel General HQ -- to disrupt efforts to bring the situation under 
control after the violence of the previous months. Nie, Xia and Peng had organized 
forces in mountainous and isolated areas with the avowed aim of bringing down 
United Headquarters and its military and civilian allies. Nie had posed as a 
correspondent and the secretary of an unnamed leader in the central government. 
With these credentials he convened meetings of mass organization leaders to "use 
the village to encircle the cities" from armed bases. The trio opposed the August 1967 
reorganization of the military control commission and supported Jiang Hua whom, 
they claimed with justification, was protected by the Central Committee. Even after 
the formation of the ZPRC, in conjunction with leaders of local mass organizations 
they had allegedly plotted to establish an "armed independent regime" in the 

mountains. 
       The article speculated as to how the three men could have been so active and 
have built up so much influence, how they could have coordinated their activities 
so closely, and how they had become so popular and important "as to be able to issue 
directives, receive reports and talk about the situation at gatherings of thousands . 
Minutes of these meetings had been printed and extensively disseminated. Zhejiang 
74        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 Daily also wondered why the arrest of these three ringleaders had not brought about 
 a cessation of "criminal activities" especially in southern Zhejiang, and why they 
 had been openly defended after their arrest. The newspaper did not have many 
 convincing answers to these rhetorical questions but it is clear that such an 
 organized resistance force, backed up by former officials, would have posed 
 enormous problems for the relatively inexperienced and far from united new 
 administration. The report confirmed that the Cultural Revolution lacked support 
 in the countryside and that peasants and grassroots cadres had remained loyal to 
 their old leaders and patrons. A mid-July 1968 Zhejiang Daily editorial analyzed the 
 phenomenon in Zhuji county, Shaoxing district. It asked rhetorically: 

        "In earlier periods of the great proletarian cultural revolution in Zhuji 
        county, why was resistance so powerful? Why was the struggle by force so 
        serious? Why were the conservative forces so strong?" One answer it 
        supplied was that "The cobras who hide themselves under the cloak of 
        old Party members, old cadres, old revolutionaries and old guerrillas 
        have remained in their own localities for more than a decade or even 
        several decades".7 

        Further trials took place in Hangzhou at which sentences ranging from ten 
  years' imprisonment to the death penalty were handed down.8 Trials were also 
  conducted in provincial centers with editorials supporting the tough penalties being 
  imposed.9 On 9 and 26 September 1968, the ZPRC issued further notices against 
  "counter-revolutionary" activity.10 At later trials in Hangzhou a new organization 
  called the Hangzhou Social Order Headquarters 
  fjJS) was mentioned publicly for the first time. Members of the organization acted in 
  place of public security personnel, escorting the arrested suspects before the tribunals. 
  A leader of United Headquarters, He Xianchun, a short intense man who liked 
  fighting,11 and Xia Genfa organized and led the contingent.12 
        Such groups appeared in other Chinese cities in 1968.13 Their duties included 
  patrolling the streets, checking registration bona fides and guarding factories and 
  government installations, tasks that had previously been the responsibility of the 
  public security forces and the PLA. The social order command thus relieved the 
  military of some of its civil commitments.14 However, the worker provosts made 
  themselves very unpopular by their abuse of power and excessive use of force.15 On 
  7 August 1968, Minister of Public Security Xie Fuzhi launched a blistering attack on 
  the public security/procuratorate/court network. Xie called for the complete 
  destruction of the system Mand in response a wholesale 
  purge of the apparatus took place. The creation of social order commands was thus 
  associated with the smashing of the old security network.16 
         The first reported mobilization of the social order command took place in 
   August 1968.17 On 6 August, discord erupted between the factions at the Hangzhou 
                                                                           ORDER AND UNITY 75 

No. 1 Cotton Printing and Dyeing Mill.18 The mill was the unit of one of Red 
Storm's leaders. Fang Jianwen.19 Fang's faction there had refused to obey a cease-fire 
order and form an alliance with its rival group, so the social order command was 
directed to intervene. The workers had previously disregarded the presence of PLA 
troops and orders from the HMRC to stop the fighting. Leaders of the social order 
command probably had less scruples in applying some muscle. On the afternoon of 7 
August, the HMRC called on the command to move into the factory. After the social 
order command issued eight open letters in rapid succession without producing any 
effect, it sent in Peoples' Guards (APcilIl) to "awaken" the resisters. In 
thirteen hours they had brought the situation under control and by the afternoon of 
8 August production had reportedly returned to normal. 
       While the social order command dealt with factional disturbances and 
problems of law enforcement, the propaganda teams concentrated their attention on 
 students and disturbances in the localities. On 19 August the ZPRC decided to 
 establish worker-peasant propaganda teams and the first units were formed three 
 days later.20 A "suitable number" of cadres supplemented and led the workers and 
 peasants who comprised the bulk of the membership. The task of the propaganda 
 teams was to "play a leading role in helping places and units where the class 
 enemies are making trouble". The ZPRC decision also requested local PLA units to 
 organize teams and assign cadres and troops to staff them. Four brigades from 
 Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Jiaxing and Jinhua were formed21 with a total membership of 
 10,000 and they were immediately despatched to southern Zhejiang.22 
        Further violence had been reported from Wenzhou in July 1968.23 In the latter 
 half of the previous year the dty had caused a massive headache to the military 
 authorities and delivered more than a few cracked skulls to members of United 
 Headquarters who had ventured down there. An editorial of Zhejiang Daily in late 

 July 1968 revealed that 

        A series of serious political incidents in the areas of south Zhejiang at 
        present indicate the frenzied, last-ditch struggle desperately carried out by 
        the handful of class enemies after an even sharper class struggle. 

 On 18 July Mao Zedong issued personal instructions to the authorities in Zhejiang to 
 suppress the Wenzhou insurrection. Maoâs directives were hailed in a large rally 
 held in Hangzhou on 25 July. Those responsible for the trouble in Wenzhou were 
 accused of opposing the PLA and striving to undermine its unity. Calls were made to 
 the proletarian revolutionaries to back the PLA "no matter what time and no matter 
 what circumstances". The authorities promised lenient treatment to members of 
 fighting factions who desisted, while threatening punishment of the ringleaders. 

        The bad elements of the two different groups [elaborated one editorial] 
        must be dealt with separately by the masses of the respective groups. At 
        the same time, the bad elements who have sneaked into an organization 
76        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

       must be strictly separated from the masses of the same organization. 

 No distinction was drawn between the rival organizations; sanctions would be 

 applied mercilessly to them both. 
       The "counter-revolutionaries" of Wenzhou had engaged in the same 
 disruptive activities which were described in the two central documents concerning 
 Guangxi and Shaanxi, referred to at the beginning of this chapter. They had ignored 
 all orders to stop. Reports made particular mention of outsiders and rusticated 
 educated youth "now loafing in cities" and causing the disturbances. These outsiders 
 were directed to return to their own localities. As a supplement to the central notices 
 and Mao's directives, and as a display of its determination to deal firmly with unruly 
 behavior, the ZPRC issued its own notice regarding the trouble on 5 August. An 
 editorial of the same day admitted that the instigators, described colorfully as "black 
 talons", had "performed quite outstandingly". They had spread the "reactionary 
 theory of many centers" and split the "proletarian Headquarters". 
       Words turned to action in August. Early in the month the ZPRC despatched 
 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to Wenzhou, despite holding little hope 
 for their success. The first teams were composed of 4,000 PLA soldiers and 
 "proletarian revolutionaries" from United Headquarters.24 Given the history of 
 confrontation in Wenzhou, the inclusion of members of outside mass organizations 
 in the teams was provocative. For its part United Headquarters viewed its mission as 
 working 

       together with the local proletarian revolutionaries to eliminate the 
       renegades, blast the lid off the class struggle, propagate the revolutionary 
       fighting call of the Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, stop struggle 
       by force and help local proletarian revolutionaries realize the 
       revolutionary great alliance. 

 United Headquartersâ interference in a local disturbance clearly went outside the 
 guidelines laid down for both mass organizations by Zhou Enlai in March 1968. 
       The first contingent was reinforced by a brigade of the newly-established 
 worker-peasant propaganda team from Hangzhou Municipality, which departed the 
 provincial capital on 25 August for Wenzhou. The brigade also left determined to 
 "lift the lid off class struggle in southern Zhejiang". At Jinhua it detrained to motor 
 transport for the remainder of the journey to Wenzhou. On 26 August, as the 
 brigade passed through Qingtian county, home of Zhejiang's famous soapstone, it 
 was met by forces organized by Wenzhou's Rebel General HQ. A major 
 confrontation took place that afternoon before the brigade finally reached its 
 destination. The same evening, at the large rally held in the dty, representatives 
 from the Rebel General HQ attended but three of its leaders, Yao Guolin, Wu 
 Zhixiang and Zhang Weisen were publicly criticized 
 and detained by the military. 
                                                                            ORDER AND UNITY 77 

       At the end of August the occupying forces sent out teams to visit three 
communes and fifty enterprises and units. Their task was to disseminate the Central 
Committee notices of July. The propaganda teams did not dare venture outside the 
 city limits, however, because of the strength of Rebel General HQ in the counties 
 surrounding Wenzhou. But they had been entrusted with propagating central and 
 provincial directives and for this they needed to contact local officials. An example 
 of one ingenious way around this dilemma was publicized in the press. One 
 detachment went to the Wenzhou Chemical Works, which sold ammonia to cadres 
 who purchased it on behalf of production teams and brigades. When they arrived at 
 the chemical works the local cadres were subjected to lectures by members of the 
 propaganda team. Only in mid-October did propaganda team detachments venture 
 into district towns on the outskirts of Wenzhou. 
        In early September 1,700 reinforcements arrived in Wenzhou by ship, the port 
 finally having been reopened.25 By the end of September, the local party leader 
 Wang Fang and with his deputy Li Tiefeng were named in an 
 editorial published by Zhejiang Daily. They were described as the agents of Liu 
 Shaoqi in Wenzhou who, together with the leaders of Rebel General HQ, had carried 
 out "ferocious class revenge with savage hatred on the proletarian revolutionaries'. 
 The editorial claimed that their objective had been to prevent the establishment of a 
 revolutionary committee in the district and municipality. In this endeavor Wang 
  and his supporters achieved notable success. Revolutionary committees in 
 Wenzhou were not established until early December and factional differences 
  delayed the formation of the last county revolutionary committee in Wenzhou 
  District until July 1969. The propaganda teams' strategy of attacking the leaders of 
  Rebel General HQ, but not the organization itself, was based on a realistic 
  appreciation of the support that it had built up in the area. Wang Fang and his 
  colleagues had capitalized on the strength of Rebel General HQ and the parochialism 
  of the citizens of Wenzhou to muster stern opposition to outside interference. 
        A series of rallies, parades and meetings was held in Wenzhou in the months 
  leading up to the formation of the district and municipal revolutionary committees. 
  By November Wang Fang had also been linked publicly with Tan Zhenlin and Jiang 
  Hua. It was reported in December that 31,900 people had been enrolled in study 
  groups in the city. The provincial leadership demonstrated the importance it 
  attached to the reestablishment of order in Wenzhou by sending a high-powered 
  delegation consisting of Nan Ping, Lai Keke, Zhou Jianren and Zhang Yongsheng, to 
  attend the 3 December inauguration ceremony for the revolutionary committees. 
         By December, the provincial authorities felt that they had the situation under 
  control. Early that month the Hangzhou brigade returned to the provincial capital, 
  leaving behind propaganda team contingents from Shaoxing and Jinhua. An article 
  published at this time related the difficulties that the teams had confronted when 
78        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

they had arrived in Wenzhou three months before. The "class enemies" 

      were filled with deadly fear and hate when the team came to southern 
      Zhejiang Province. They framed the team with all the crimes that they 
       could dream up and cursed the team in foulest language [sic].26They 
      resorted to despicable means to disrupt the relationship between the 
       masses and propaganda team in an attempt to transform southern 
       Zhejiang into their independent kingdom. 

Even by the end of 1968, however, efforts to indoctrinate the people in Wenzhou 
with the "correct" history of the Cultural Revolution had met with little success and 
persistent opposition to the forced establishment of revolutionary committees 
remained a thorn in the side of the provincial authorities. 
       On August 25 the CCP CC had issued a notice informing the provinces to send 
propaganda teams into educational institutions.27 Then, on 26 September, People's 
Daily carried Yao Wenyuan's article "The Working Class must lead in every sphere" 
reminding Red Guards of their subordinate and dispensable status in the Cultural 
Revolution.28 On 7 and 9 September 1968 propaganda teams moved into key tertiary 
institutions in Hangzhou â Zhejiang University, Hangzhou University, Zhejiang 
Agricultural College and Zhejiang Medical College.29 On 7 October, teams entered 
other colleges and government departments.30 However, a substantial proportion of 
the students did not welcome the occupation. They argued that it was an insult to 
the role played by the Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution as well as interference 
in their internal affairs. Before the propaganda teams had entered the colleges. Red 
Guards had threatened to interrogate their proletarian supervisors and generally 
make life uncomfortable for them.31 At Hangzhou University the propaganda team 
 consisted of 350 workers. One member, aged 57, was illiterate and had never spent a 
 day at school in his life. It is not surprising that the students resented such people 
running their colleges. The authorities, however, remained steadfast. They declared 
 that "Resistance to the team is resistance to the headquarters of Chairman Mao".32 
       The Red Guards were slow to realize that their usefulness as a battering-ram to 
 knock down the gates of Jiang Huaâs provincial stronghold had ended. They had 
 indulged in anarchy and factionalism when Beijing had demanded restoration of 
 order. A conference which was held in October 1968 to discuss the work of the 
 propaganda teams affirmed the contributions of the Red Guards in the early and 
 middle stages of Cultural Revolution, but pointedly made no reference to their role 
 in its later stages.33 At a second conference in December, continuing resistance to the 
 presence of propaganda teams on campuses was reported 34 Zhang Yongsheng, now 
 a member of and spokesman for the leadership hierarchy, delivered the report to the 
 conference. The rebels of yesterday had become the new proponents and upholders 
 of order. 

       By the end of September 1968 the forces of law and order seemed to have 
                                                                           ORDER AND UNITY 79 

crushed most resistance to their rule. Criticism of Jiang Hua resumed and the 
general situation was declared stable.35 But the cost of obtaining stability had been 
great. The initial victims of the Cultural Revolution, the intellectuals, now faced not 
the spontaneous violence of their students but the cold-blooded persecution of 
military-dominated revolutionary committees. Disgraced cadres, especially those 
who were not party members, had their files scrutinized for material that could be 
 construed as evidence of pre-1949 collaboration with the KMT. Rebels and Red 
 Guards, persecutors in 1966-67, were now mercilessly tracked down and dealt with as 
 "May 16" elements. Institutionalized savagery reigned. 

 Termination of the Cultural Revolution, October-December 1968 

        The victors of the Cultural Revolution pronounced their verdict on the 
 political struggles of the previous two years at the 12th plenum of the 8th CCP CC, 
 held between 13 and 31 October 1968. What concerned Zhejiang most directly was 
 the plenum's judgment of the issues and events which had contributed most to 
 factionalism in the province. Above all this involved an assessment of the 1967 
 "February Countercurrent". The communique of the meeting declared that the 

 "current" had been 

        directed against the decisions of the 11th Plenary Session of the Eighth 
        Central Committee, against the great proletarian cultural revolution and 
        against the proletarian headquarters. The Plenary Session holds that the 
        shattering of the "adverse February current" and the sinister trend last 
        spring [1968] to reverse the correct verdict on the "adverse February 
        current" was an important victory for Chairman Maoâs proletarian 
        revolutionary line.36 

        According to Chinese sources Mao and Lin Biao held slightly different attitudes 
  towards the "February Countercurrent". Nie Rongzhen, one of the PLA marshalls 
  involved in the events, has quoted excerpts from Lin Biaoâs 26 October speech to the 
  plenum and contrasted his position with that of Maoâs, which the Chairman put 
  forward in his 31 October speech to the plenumâs closing session.37 Lin Biao 
  described the "current" as a "serious anti-party incident", a "preview for the 
  restoration of capitalism" and a continuation of the Liu-Deng line. Nie reported Mao 
  as expressing puzzlement over the whole affair, which is surprising considering that 
  Mao was reported by one source to have been present at one of the meetings in 
  February 1967. However, whether the Chairman was present or not, he certainly had 
  been fully briefed by Zhou Enlai and Zhang Chunqiao on the incident33 Now Mao 
  stated that as members of leading bodies those implicated had held the right to 
  express their views, that they had done so openly and that the whole dispute was 

  merely an example of inner-party debate.39 
         Maoâs forgiving attitude may have stemmed from well-developed political 
80        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

instincts which foresaw the support of the veteran military leaders as a useful 
counter-weight to Lin Biao and his military allies. The fate of Deng Xiaoping was 
another instance where Mao refused to go along with the wishes of his closest 
supporters. Lin Biao and civilian radicals such as Jiang Qing reportedly wished to 
expel Deng from the CCP at this plenum. The Chairman refused.40 If he had 
relented, the rehabilitation of Deng four years later would have been much more 
difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish. 
       In the month preceding the convocation of the plenum Beijing had announced 
that the Cultural Revolution was entering the phase of "struggle, criticism and 
transformation".41 Six factories and two universities in Beijing, as well as PLA unit 
8341 led by the head of Mao's bodyguard Wang Dongxing, were chosen as model 
units in the campaign. The plenum set four tasks for the implementation of 
"struggle, criticism and transformation": revolutionary mass criticism and 
repudiation, purification of class ranks, consolidation and rebuilding of the CCP and 
revolution in the superstructure (principally the discipline of students by worker 
propaganda teams on campuses).42 The campaign was not called to a halt until the 
death of Lin Biao in September 1971. 
       Revolutionary mass criticism and repudiation were terms for the wholesale 
assault on ideas regarding the dying out of class struggle, party building and human 
nature attributed to Liu Shaoqi. The purification of the class ranks was an intense, 
violent political movement which had commenced in May 1968 in Shanghai.43 It 
was directed principally at traditional class and political enemies known as the five 
black categories (M â landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, 
bad elements and rightists â as well as spies, traitors and capitalist-roaders. It 
permitted a vast, indiscriminate and arbitrary sweep through the ranks of disgraced 
cadres, intellectuals. Red Guards and other rebels. "Leftist" opponents of the regime 
were struck down as members of the May 16 group. A Central Committee notice of 
27 March 1970 admitted that up to one in seven people in certain units had been 
categorized as May 16 elements. Revolution in the superstructure encompassed not 
only the selection of new methods for enrolling university students, but extended to 
the forced rustication of city students and youth to the countryside and the 
establishment of May 7 cadre schools for the rotational training of office cadres.44 
       The decisions of the CC 12th plenum were discussed at a marathon forty-four 
day congress of ZPRC party members 

                 ) held from 8 November until 21 December 1968. The congress 
also selected delegates for the forthcoming national party congress. Apart from 
summarizing the significance of the 12th plenum in Beijing, the five-point 
resolution published at the conclusion of the meeting reviewed the struggles of the 
previous two years. It also repudiated rightist attacks on the Cultural Revolution, set 
out tasks for the immediate future and issued a rallying cry to win total victory.45 In 
                                                                           ORDER AND UNITY 81 

summing up the history of the Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang, resolution two 
praised the "general orientation" of the proletarian revolutionaries [United 
Headquarters] with the "workers as the main force" and forbade criticism of their 
performance "under any pretext". The resolution also commended the PLA for its 
achievements in the "three supports and two militaries". 
       The third resolution denounced three erroneous trends which had arisen 
during the course of the Cultural Revolution â the February 1967 Countercurrent, 
the spring 1968 rightist "current", and the May 1968 opposition to the "three reds" 
(that is, opposition to Mao, the PLA and revolutionary committees). The Congress 
concluded that some members of the ZPRC, including members of its standing 
committee, had been involved in plotting the February 1967 "reversal of verdicts" 
and had later tried to cover up their involvement in the conspiracy. These people 
included former secretary of the CCP ZPC Wu Xian,48 who had been prominent a 
year previously when the military authorities were searching for members of the old 
ZPC to join the ranks of "revolutionary leading cadres". They were expelled from 
the ZPRC but it was noted that the struggle against these tendencies was not 

finished. 
       While it may have been true that the military authorities in most provinces 
 faced greater dangers from discontented "leftists" who represented the spirit of the 
 Cultural Revolution and were numerous and young,47 this scenario did not apply in 
 Zhejiang, where Red Storm continued to oppose the new provincial authorities 
 with great energy. The ZPRC leadership had also failed to attract officials of the old 
 ZPC on board. The resolution of the plenum reflected this state of affairs by seeming 
 to defend United Headquarters and denounce destabilization from the "right". A 
 Hong Kong observer noted that the military leaders of Zhejiang attacked the former 
 power-holders much more assiduously than they attacked "Leftists". "The situation 
 in Chekiang", concluded the writer, "is apparently different from other provinces".48 
 The reason for this was that military leaders such as Nan Ping, Chen Liyun and 
 Xiong Yingtang all owed their positions in the Zhejiang administration to the 
 Cultural Revolution and their patron Lin Biao. They had more to fear from the 
 return of the pre-Cultural Revolution "capitalist-roaders" and Red Storm than their 
 youthful allies in United Headquarters, no matter how much of an irritant the latter 

 occasionally proved to be. 
        Earlier in 1968 the provincial press had complained about the perfunctory 
 nature of the purification of class ranks movement. In the counties the 
 commencement date for the campaign had varied from spring 1968 (Kaihua), April 
 1968 (Lanxi), July 1968 (Jiande) to February (Linhai) and May 1969 (Xiangshan) 49 
 Zhejiang Daily had published editorials and articles which seemed to indicate that 
 both recalcitrant cadres and unrepentant rebels from Red Storm were the targets of 
 the campaign.50 Deputy-governor Ren Yili, who prior to liberation had allegedly 
82     CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

betrayed members of his party branch, and a certain Yu, who had crossed over to the 
enemy in 1929 and become a special agent, were prominent victims of the campaign 
in Zhejiang. Jiang Hua had reportedly known about these senior cadres' past but had 
defended them by stating (in the most unlikely words), "giving oneself up is 
justified and reneging is no crime".51 In late 1968, as the campaign was intensified, 
further efforts were made to induce Red Storm to end its boycott of the new power 
structures. Further attacks against Jiang Hua and his subordinates were launched. 
     On 5 November, at a large rally in Hangzhou, leading capitalist-roaders of the 
CCP ZPC and HMC, including Li Fengping, Chen Weida and Wang Pingyi, were led 
onto the stage to listen to a recitation of their crimes 52 In a report of 11 November 
1968, Zhang Chunqiao had stated that it was necessary to name the leaders 
implicated in the "February Countercurrent". His report was printed and circulated 
by the CCP CC.53 Four days later the first officially-endorsed critique of Jiang Hua's 
political record was published in Zhejiang Daily.54 United Headquarters, which had 
waited almost two years for this event, may well have felt a sense of satisfaction that 
its struggle had not been in vain. However, the number and vehemence of the 
articles published against Jiang and the "February Countercurrent" indicated that a 
lengthy propaganda war would be necessary to sell the party's line to the people of 
Zhejiang. 
     A series of editorials, articles and rallies on this theme continued into 
December 1968.55 Jiang Hua was described as the focus of the struggle in Zhejiang 
during the Cultural Revolution, and held personally responsible for manipulating 
public opinion regarding his status over the previous two years. The press disclosed 
that even the unambiguous declaration of the 12th plenum concerning the 
Countercurrent had been received with incomprehension and resisted in Zhejiang. 
The crux of the issue, confessed Zhejiang Daily, was political power. Jiang's 
supporters had opposed the establishment of the ZPRC and then had refused to 
accept its authority. They had set up their own alternative political structures.55 
According to the newspaper, these facts proved that 

     Jiang Hua is still around, and his ambitions are not dead. Some of his 
     accomplices have only felt the "threatening chill of the winter wind" and 
     have not yet been frozen stiff. The ghost of Jiang Hua still haunts 
     Zhejiang Province, (ft AJEft/'Wft/ftll ft g * |sj 


Another article warned that some people 

     are spreading rumors and attacking and resisting the Zhejiang Provincial 
     Committee, which has the personal approval of our great leader 
     Chairman Mao. Creating discord between armymen and citizens, they are 
     attempting ... to turn the areas and departments under their leadership 
     into watertight independent kingdoms. 
                                                                 ORDER AND UNITY 83 

      The old CCP ZPC cadre school in Hangzhou remained a bastion of support for 
Jiang. An editorial of 10 November claimed that the capitalist-roaders in the school 
had "recently" issued an appeal to reverse the verdict handed down on Jiang and his 
colleagues. The editorial appealed to "comrades" who had supported the wrong side 
in the Cultural Revolution to recognize their mistakes and act on this recognition, 
or face the consequences.58 
      Throughout these months. Red Storm continued to resist all pressure to join 
revolutionary committees. It rejected the terms of entry laid down by the military 
 and United Headquarters. On the first anniversary of Mao's 2 December 1967 
 directive Zhejiang Daily published an editorial to commemorate the occasion.59 The 
 editorial made it clear that the struggle between the two mass organizations had 
 never ceased. Whenever a makeshift alliance had been knocked together at the top, 
 the focus of contention shifted back to each factory, college or commune. In order to 
 flatter Red Storm, the editorial stated that it too had played its part in the downfall of 
 Jiang Hua and that its representatives would help strengthen the three mass 
 congresses and revolutionary committees. All the bickering about the status of Red 
 Storm was seemingly resolved and it was now described as a "revolutionary mass 
 organization". Yet United Headquarters could not accept its rival on equal terms. 
 Turning to the members of this organization, Zhejiang Daily praised them for 
 pursuing the policy of "helping, criticizing and allying with" Red Storm. The 
 newspaper ludicrously suggested that members of Red Storm accept such 
 condescending treatment and warned that "In no circumstance should they regard 
 the help and criticism given by their comrades as suppression and refuse to accept 

 itâ. 
       Editorials of December 1968 revealed that the campaign to purify class ranks 
 was meeting strong opposition. At the 12th plenum Mao had counselled against 
 forced confessions and on 1 December he had directed that the fewer cadres be 
 attacked and the role of education emphasized.60 Veteran cadres and long-serving 
 party members undoubtedly objected strongly to the practice of youthful rebels 
 examining their past records and subjecting them to interrogation, an exercise which 
 often degenerated into abuse and torture, despite Mao's injunctions. Nevertheless, 
 for this latest phase of the Cultural Revolution these cadres had attempted to seize 
  the initiative. They had coined the phrase, "Revolutionaries can be relied on in 
 revolution but conservatives are to be relied on in purification . The 
  "conservatives" argued, with some justification, that the purification of class ranks 
  could have been carried out without the Cultural Revolution. But such remarks 
  were heresy. The "conservatives" also resurrected the theory of lineage 
  T&), which they had waved in the face of class enemies on previous occasions, and 
  described their youthful adversaries as untrustworthy, unreliable and undeserving 

  of support.6^ 
84       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

      However, apart from making scapegoats of several senior officials, and purging 
Jiang Hua's remaining followers,62 the authorities proceeded with caution.63 In line 
with the Chairman's instructions on the matter, they prohibited the use of duress to 
obtain evidence and directed, "never let a single bad element escape or harm a good 
element by mistake". Cadres were the key to the creation of the three-way alliance, 
lectured the Zhejiang Daily, and asserted that even capitalist-roaders, so long as they 
had not betrayed the party, should be allowed to resume work. It is not surprising 
that some people wondered why the Cultural Revolution had been necessary in the 
first place.64 In January 1969, in a warning against restoration |H), Zhang 
Yongsheng gave vent to feelings which were probably widespread among the 
rebels.65 
      1968 ended with the publication of Maoâs instructions to educated youth to go 
 up to the mountains and down to the countryside ( hlJj ~F~ ^ ).66 Young people 
joined production and construction brigades or lived with peasants in production 
 teams. Many city youth traveled and settled down in such harsh, distant regions as 
 Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Manchuria and Yunnan. Others, with better contacts, 
 went no further than richer suburban communes surrounding major cities. The 
 first contingent from Zhejiang left for Heilongjiang on the day that Maoâs directive 
 was published.67 The rustication program had several unspoken aims: first to 
 relieve urban unemployment; second to show privileged urban youth the grim 
 reality of China's countryside; and third to clear the cities of rebel trouble-makers, 
 well-practised in the art of organization and mobilization and independent in 
 thought and action. Undoubtedly the military authorities in Zhejiang ensured that 
 the selection procedures met these aims in full. 

 The "Revolutionary Alliance" and the Dissolution of the Mass Organizations, 
 May-September 1969 

      In 1969 the military authorities who exercised control over the ZPRC appeared 
 to take a harder line against the disgruntled rebels. Their new-found determination 
 to grasp the nettle stemmed from a twenty-three day meeting convened in Beijing in 
 January by the central authorities to deal with continuing factionalism in Zhejiang. 
 The meeting discussed the problems within the military caused by the "two 
 reorganizations" of August 1967 and endorsed the Lin Biao-backed leadership of the 
 province. Former leaders of the ZPMD were censured and persecuted.68 An order 
 was issued to the two mass organizations that their disruptive activities must come 
 to an end and that the time for negotiations had arrived. Red Stormâs Fang Jianwen, 
 who was a principal opponent of any alliance, was criticized for his stand.69 
      Unified leadership meant that the public airing of differences with 
 revolutionary committees was not permitted and such practices were condemned as 
 manifestations of ultra-democracy.70 Reference was made to the attempt by certain 
                                                                 ORDER AND UNITY 85 

people to establish a second headquarters as an alternative to the ZPRC, and their 
determination to foster division between the PLA and the revolutionary 
committees, between different units of the PLA and between mass organizations and 
revolutionary committees.71 A major article carried by Zhejiang Daily entitled, "The 
Bankruptcy of Jiang Hua's 'Independent Kingdom"', made pointed references to 
groups which disobeyed orders and placed their sectional interests above those of the 
whole.72 
      The status of mass representatives on revolutionary committees was made 
 painfully clear in an article concerning the unified leadership of the Shaoxing 
 County Revolutionary Committee. Mass representatives were instructed to learn 
 from the experience of their PLA and civilian cadre colleagues. The latter two groups 
 in turn deigned to "think highly" of their junior partners' role on the committees 73 
 At the third enlarged plenum of the ZPRC, which was held from 25 February to 6 
 March, it was announced that the attempt to reverse the verdict on the February 
 Countercurrent in Zhejiang had been defeated 74 An editorial celebrating the first 
 anniversary of the establishment of the ZPRC, which was published on 23 March 
 1969, declared that one of the major struggles in Zhejiang since November 1968 had 
 centered on the elimination of the influence of the February 1967 Countercurrent.73 
 Responsibility for the attempt was later attributed to Red Storm's leader Fang 
 Jianwen.76 So as to ram home the message to Fang's supporters, on the final day of 
 the plenum, Zhejiang Daily carried a 25 February editorial from "Red Stormâ 
 entitled "The Victors face the greatest danger" warning 
 of the dangers of arrogance, self-satisfaction and individualism which accompanied 
 victory.77 
       The propaganda of a year earlier admitting to the existence of factions and 
  differentiating between proletarian and bourgeois factions had ceased. In its place 
  was a shrill exhortation against factions per se and continued calls to uphold unified 
  iâjtit) leadership. The communique of the plenum admitted that "In many 
  respects Chekiang lags behind other provinces and municipalities". It enjoined mass 
  organizations to refrain from "exchanges of revolutionary experience" and called on 
  the PLA to support the revolutionary committees. On the first anniversary of the 
  establishment of the ZPRC Lai Keke, Xiong Yingtang and Zhang Yongsheng, 
  representing the tripartite alliance of civilian cadres, the military and mass 
  representatives, published articles in Zhejiang Daily pledging to uphold the 
  authority of the ZPRC.78 A Zhejiang Daily editorial of late March pointed out the 
  danger of certain people placing revolutionary committees under their own control 
  or the control of their particular organizations.79 
        Yet despite the warnings and threats, renewed efforts in 1969 to root out 
  opposition to the ZPRC and finally bring about the long sought-after alliance of the 
  two mass organizations met disinterest or resistance. The opposition was categorized 
86      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

a leftist deviation and those upholding it as "regal isolationists .80 The belief that 
leftist mistakes were less serious than those of the right, because they involved 
mistakes of method not political line, was rejected Â« In a harsh warning to members 
of United Headquarters and Red Storm who were holding out against the alliance of 
the two organizations, Zhejiang Daily stated that they faced the possibility of 
becoming revisionists.82 
      It was the 9th Congress of the CCP, held from 1 to 24 April 1969,83 that gave 
renewed impetus to the question of unity. On 16 April ten thousand study classes 
with 200,000 participants commenced in Hangzhou.84 Party members of the ZPRC 
held a Congress from 9 to 31 May to study the documents of the 9th Congress and to 
attempt to resolve once and for all the outstanding issue of Red Storm s 
participation in the provincial power-structure.85 The provincial congress took place 
in two stages. From 9 to 13 May, 1,000 delegates attended, while from 14 May the 
number was increased to 7,000. 
      The most important event occurred on 26 May when a meeting was held to 
welcome Red Stormâs decision to return to the fold.86 Convened jointly by the ZPRC 
and HMRC, the meeting announced the inclusion of Red Storm representatives in 
 the standing committees of the provincial worker, peasant and Red Guard 
 Congresses, the HMRC and its standing committee, and a recommendation that 
 representatives from Red Storm join the ZPRC. The report of the meeting stated that 
 the ZPRC and HMRC had discussed the issue of Red Storm's representation many 
 times but that differences over interpretation of the contentious February 1967 
 events had held up resolution of the problem. In 1969 the Central Committee had 
 issued instructions on the matter, which had led the Zhejiang and Hangzhou 
 revolutionary committees to hold study classes for members of Red Storm. After the 
 9th CCP Congress, Red Storm's standing committee had studied the question again 
 and drawn up an acceptable namelist, based on the original agreement of February 
 1.    
      The speeches delivered at the meeting took unity as their theme. In the words 
 of Wang Zida, chairman of the HMRC, "Unity means force, unity means weapons 
 and unity brings us victory". Deputy-commander of the ZPMD, Wan Zhenxi (Jj 
        stated that Red Storm's participation in the provincial leadership was 
 "required by the revolution and by the circumstances" and declared that it was the 
 "common desire and pressing demand" of the people of Zhejiang. Wan addressed 
 remarks to members of both organizations. To Red Storm he expressed the hope that 
 it would be modest, prudent and vigilant against those who sought to wreck the 
 hard-won unity. To United Headquarters he urged it to "take the initiative" in 
 uniting with Red Storm. 
       Spokesmen for the two sides contributed the appropriate rhetorical flourishes 
 and the report pictured the "fighters" of both groups studying "happily together" and 
                                                                 ORDER AND UNITY 87 

encouraging each other. To mark the occasion a joint editorial of Zhejiang Daily and 
Hangzhou Daily was published which claimed that while United Headquarters had 
given way on trifling matters (that is, power!) it had stood its ground on matters of 
 principle.87 It is clear that United Headquarters and Red Storm remained embroiled 
 in disputes over their respective roles in the Cultural Revolution. Prospects for real 
 and lasting unity seemed slim while such debates raged. 
      Additionally, a number of Red Storm members refused to accept the agreement 
 and campaigned energetically and with some success to undermine it. The main 
 leader of the breakaway group was one of Red Storm's most resolute and capable 
 leaders, the former textile worker and party member Fang Jianwen. Fang's obduracy 
 alarmed the provincial leadership greatly, as can be gauged from the fact that in 
 August 1969 Zhejiang Daily issued two single-sheet special issues devoted 
 entirely to recounting and repudiating Fang's exploits.88 The special issues appeared 
 shortly after the release of Central Committee document Number 48, dated 4 August 
 1969, approving public criticism of Fang ([Hjig^tTl 
 ffifrÂ«J, \>1 Jft ft IMtiUM). The details of Fangâs deeds make fascinating 
 reading and give further insight into the machinations of factional politics during 
 this period. 
       Fang came from a poor peasant family in Zhuji County, situated south of 
 Hangzhou in Shaoxing District. Before coming to the provincial capital to work at 
 the No. 1 cotton mill, he had been a rural cadre, and in 1962 had been found guilty of 
 speculating in satin and exchanging it for grain. In 1965, during the "four clean-ups". 
 Fang's peccadillo had been discovered and noted in his file. The incident was 
 undoubtedly a motivating factor in Fangâs decision to rebel in the Cultural 
 Revolution, in the same way as similar incidents contributed to the rebellion of 
  Wang Hongwen and Weng Senhe. 
       The articles disclosed that Fang had masterminded Red Stormâs disruption of 
  the rally convened by United Headquarters on 12 February 1967 and alleged that he 
  had supported Jiang Hua ever since that date. In the summer of 1968 he had been 
  responsible for violent incidents at factories and colleges in Hangzhou as well as 
  convening meetings of groups opposed to United Headquarters in southern and 
  eastern Zhejiang. The bases of Fang's support were Zhejiang University, Taizhou 
  District in eastern Zhejiang and his unit, the No. 1 cotton mill and he had 
  maintained links with Nie Minzhi, Xia Liangchang and Peng Zhangxun, whose 
  activities and trial were related earlier in this chapter. 
        Fang's most spectacular exploits took place in 1969. After the provincial 
  congress of the ZPRC in late 1968, at which he was forced to confess his mistakes. 
  Fang went to the offshore islands of Zhoushan to organize a counter-attack against 
  the local branch of United Headquarters. In this endeavor he was most successful. 
  Between February and perhaps April of that year8^ Fang mobilized his supporters 
88       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 with assistance from the local military (the 22nd Army commanded by Cao Siming 
 and Tie Ying) reportedly to drive 20,000 members of the local United Headquarters' 
 branch off Zhoushan and back onto the mainland. His strategy was to mould public 
 opinion in Hangzhou, stir up fighting in southern Zhejiang, make Zhoushan a 
 model and set up a base in Siming mountains in eastern Zhejiang (tftfll 

 tt,8frm65 40j8j # fa 0$ W^Â£&>â¢ ^ May 
 1969 Fang was summoned seven times to attend the provincial congress of ZPRC 
 party members but refused. He tried to establish a Zhejiang Province Red Storm 
 Revolutionary Committee. Later, in a move that must have won him full marks for 
 audacity if nothing else. Fang set up a "flood relief headquarters" (^ft 
 at the Hangzhou silk complex, the base of his former comrade and now bitter 
 factional enemy Weng Senhe. 
       Fang strongly opposed the agreement of May 1969. Immediately following the 
 meeting of 27 May 1969, he and other oppositionists from Red Storm set off for 
 Beijing to voice their grievances. Qiu Honggen, a member of the delegation, and the 
 contemporary denunciation of Fang have both recorded versions of the events 
 which ensued.90 The two hundred-member delegation arrived in the capital on 4 
 June. The CC liaison reception station found it accommodation and food. However, 
 the delegation's attempts to find sympathetic listeners came to nought. On 12 June, 
 incensed by a Xinhua report concerning Zhejiang, Fang led twenty-four people to the 
 organizationâs offices. The Beijing authorities responded by despatching a military 
 propaganda team from the local garrison. Fang also led a boycott of the "study class" 
 arranged by cadres who had traveled up from Hangzhou. Subsequently, his group 
 was arrested and escorted back to Zhejiang, reportedly on the orders of Chen Boda 
 and Yao Wenyuan. On 11 August the group was confined to military barracks and 
 ordered to hold their "study class". Qiu Honggen has described in detail the 
 interrogation, deprivation and torture that he experienced for the next three and a 
 half years. 
       The destruction of Fang Jianwenâs influence and credibility was vital to the 
 provincial leadership as a precondition for the dissolution of both mass 
 organizations. Therefore, on 23 August and 3 September, meetings were held to 
 announce that both United Headquarters and Red Storm had "gloriously completed 
 their historical missions" JS ^p)-91 The repudiation 
 of Fang Jianwen was a major item at the meetings. In the assessment of the relative 
 contributions of the two organizations to the Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang, 
 speakers made it very clear that Red Storm's mistakes and the "tortuous road" it had 
 followed since 1967 relegated it to second position. Chen Liyun announced at the 
 second of the two meetings that all inter-unit mass organizations in the various 
 districts and counties of the province would be dissolved by 10 September. One 
 immediate side-effect of the dissolution of Red Storm and United Headquarters was 
                                                                           ORDER AND UNITY 89 

the announcement, at the end of September, that Zhejiang Daily was henceforth to 
appear as the official organ of the ZPRC.97 
       While outwardly the two groups "lowered their flags" and disbanded their 
formal organizational structures, factional alliances continued in a different form.93 
They went underground and drew on relationships forged for mutual protection 
and support over the preceding three years. In the case of United Headquarters an 
underground command center was established.94 In 
September 1973, a big-character poster written under the direction of Zhang 
Yongsheng did not deny the charge by the ZPC leadership that such a center 
 existed.95 The two factions may have ceased formal activities under their respective 
 banners of United Headquarters and Red Storm, but the factional alignments 

 remained as firm and as clear-cut as before. 
        Although their names were not publicly announced at the time, new members 
 did join the leadership bodies in 1969. Jiang Baodi (jQl 3^ $5^)/ a silk worker at the 
 Hangzhou Spun Silk Fabric Mill appeared as a member of the standing committee of 
 the ZPRC at the end of May. In April she had been elected an alternate member of 
 the CCP 9th CC. Navy commander, Xie Zhenghao, later joined the ZPRC as a Vice- 
 chairman.96 He was almost certainly a supporter of Red Storm. Nevertheless, the 
 terms of the alliance specifying the number of places allotted to Red Storm, which 
 were announced by Zhou Enlai in March 1968, were certainly not honored. 
 Nevertheless, Red Storm activists were to some extent constrained from 
 maintaining their hostile stand toward revolutionary committees by membership of 
 leading bodies and participation in the decision-making process. Disillusionment set 
 in, however, and complaints such as "it is a loss to be a cadre and it will be 
 harmful to oneself if one is firm in oneâs stand" were reported.97 
        The problem of factionalism, which had afflicted the two rival mass 
 organizations since 1967, appeared endemic notwithstanding the much-publicized 
  and much-heralded reconciliation of May 1969. Certainly, the strife and mutual 
  hostilities were not confined to Zhejiang. A notice of the CCP CC dated 23 July 1969 
  referred to violent clashes and armed struggles in Shanxi province and ordered the 
  PLA to suppress those responsible with all its might.95 Articles in the People's Daily 
  called for equal treatment of rival organizations and advocated the method used in 
  Anhui province of holding study classes for mass organization leaders 99 Rivalry 
  and fighting between mass organizations was also noted in other provinces.100 
         The links established and developed between worker rebels and student Red 
  Guards in the years 1966-68 proved difficult to uncouple. The Maoist leadership had 
  dealt with the Red Guard problem by means of rustication, military discipline and 
  the despatch of worker propaganda teams to occupy campuses and exercise 
  proletarian leadership over educational institutions. Zhang Yongsheng spent time 
  in the countryside, despite his status as a Vice-chairman of the provincial 
90      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

revolutionary committee. Lingering unrest amongst the industrial workforce, 
however, demanded a more sensitive and restrained approach. Support from 
workers for their student allies kept alive the cross-unit factional links that the 
authorities had been at pains to suppress since the end of 1967.101 
      The relative standing of the two rebel mass organizations in Zhejiang was 
reflected in the choice of personnel to attend the Beijing celebrations of the 
twentieth anniversary of the PRC. It is alleged that criteria handed down by the 
central authorities for the selection of worker representatives stipulated that they 
must come from third-generation worker families.103 Representatives from 
workers, poor and lower-middle peasants. Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, 
revolutionary intellectuals and the PLA made up the various provincial 
delegations.103 The thirty delegates who comprised the Zhejiang delegation came 
from all these categories. Of the less than ten individuals whose identities are 
known, it is evident that the presence of the principal leaders of United 
Headquarters -- Zhang Yongsheng, He Xianchun and the defector Weng Senhe â 
was not matched by representation from the leadership of Red Storm. The Zhejiang 
University Red Guard leader from Red Storm, Liu Ying, was present, but 
conspicuous by their absence were other leaders of Red Storm, Fang Jianwen and 
Teng Zhu in particular, who had not accepted the terms of the May alliance. 
      It appears, therefore, that the most prominent leaders rebels from United 
Headquarters had been spared the rustication, incarceration or even execution that 
 their fellow rebels in other provinces had suffered. The close links between the 
military rulers of Zhejiang and United Headquarters remained strong enough for 
 them to be spared such treatment. Another feature of the Zhejiang delegation was 
 the lack of "revolutionary cadres" included. The only civilian cadre present who had 
served in the pre-Cultural Revolution power structure appeared to be former 
 Deputy-secretary of the old Hangzhou party committee â Zhou Feng (jf] il$). 
      In 1969, the Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang ended with the PLA firmly in 
control of provincial affairs. It was a military leadership whose loyalties lay firmly 
with its masters in Beijing, and Lin Biao, in particular. The extravagant praise of Lin 
contained in a Zhejiang Daily editorial of April 1969 was evidence of this. The 
obsequiousness of the provincial leadership toward Lin had been noted in 1968 and 
1969 in Hong Kong.104 "Middle- and lower-ranking military men" such Nan Ping, 
Xiong Yingtang and Chen Liyun, have been described as "extensions of Lin's 
'mountain strongholds'".105 Additionally, Zhejiang's military leadership was 
unfamiliar with the conditions of the province and lacked the administrative skills 
and experience to run the administration. The former CCP ZPC had been decimated 
by the Cultural Revolution and the painful process of cadre rehabilitation, which 
commenced at the grass roots level, would not reach into the upper echelons of 
cadres until after Lin Biao's demise. 
                                                                 ORDER AND UNITY 91 

      The military ruled a divided, shell-shocked population. Three years of 
violence, extremism and ceaseless disruption left a legacy which would take years to 
 overcome. Students, young workers and peasants, who in 1966 had responded to 
 Mao's request to "bombard the headquarters", returned to their posts or 
 contemplated a future life in the countryside. Factional enmities would not 
 disappear because of signatures on documents. A war of words regarding the rights 
 and wrongs of the events of the Cultural Revolution broke out in offices and 
 workshops which would poison work relations and further retard work efficiency. 
 In retrospect, the events of 1966-69 were only the first round in a contest that paused 
 for breathing-space before resuming with full ferocity in 1973. 
       The Cultural Revolution had traversed a bumpy road in Zhejiang.106 By mid- 
  1969 the central authorities may have stabilized the province but they had achieved 
  it at a tremendous cost. The few members of the old administration who displayed 
  loyalty to the new order owed their position to factional groups and military 
  backing. United Headquarters, which had slavishly followed the somersault policy 
  directives of Mao and the Cultural Revolution Group, discovered that its loyalty 
  was not repaid when expediency and necessity brought the turmoil to an end. Red 
  Storm, which had defied central directives, paid a price but not, in the eyes of 
  United Headquarters at least, one commensurate with the degree of its defiance. 
       Rebellion and factionalism had marked the course of the Cultural Revolution 
 and in its particular features was its legacy to the Chinese political system. From the 
 central to the local level, factional ties were strengthened even further and 
 organizational discipline was correspondingly weakened. Leaders and activists of 
 mass organizations, now members of revolutionary committees, brought a new 
 dimension to factional politics. When the struggle for political ascendancy was made 
 more urgent by the question of succession which became a more salient issue in the 
 CCP as the 1970s progressed, factionalism, accompanied by renewed rebellion of a 
 more potent nature than that which occurred in 1967, debilitated the political system 
 to an even greater extent. How and why this took place forms the subject of the 
 following chapters.
