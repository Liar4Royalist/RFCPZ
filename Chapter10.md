                  CONSOLIDATION AND RENEWED INSTABILITY, 
                             AUGUST 1975-SEPTEMBER 1976 


 Upholding the Line of Deng Xiaoping in Zhejiang, August-December 1975 

      By 9 August 1975 the situation in Hangzhou appeared sufficiently stable for 
 the CCP ZPC to convene a work conference under the guidance of Wang 
 Hongwen and Ji Dengkui.1 The report of the conference made no mention of Ji 
 and Wang's presence at the conference but it is certain that they did attend.2 The 
 main theme of the work conference concerned the questions of party leadership 
 and the unity of the working class. Deng Xiaoping's instructions were conveyed 
 regarding the establishment of strong, unified and militant leading groups, which 
 placed "daring" first and possessed the determination to 
 overcome bourgeois factionalism. Deng was making a deliberate and striking 
 reference to Point 3 of the CC's August 1966 16 point manifesto launching the 
 Cultural Revolution, which had called on the party leadership to "put daring 
 above everything else and boldly arouse the masses".4 Delegates to the conference 
 visited the silk complex to see first hand the rapid changes that had occurred since 
 Weng's arrest. Both the "two crashthroughs" and the party’s class line in the 
 period of socialism were subjected to close scrutiny. While the center's decisive 
 handling of the "Zhejiang problem" may have created a mood of optimism, 
 delegates were reminded that "The struggle has not yet come to an end". That 
 factionalism had seriously affected industrial enterprises was highlighted by the 
 quotation of Mao's 1967 statement that there was no fundamental conflict of 
interests within the working class. 
      The success of the consolidation program in Zhejiang depended heavily on 
 the continuation of the detente between Deng and the radicals in Beijing. It was 
also dependent on both local factions upholding the tacit cease-fire which had 
been imposed on them. A provincial broadcast of 18 August urged its listeners to 
"see the conformity between obedience to the leadership of the Party Center and 
that to the leadership of the local Party Committees" (lAlRIM 
230 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

China News Summary commented: "This and other reports have indicated that 
the radicals, although they respect the Party Center, seek to defy orders from local 
Party organizations".5 However, unity at the center was transient and fragile as 
events were soon to prove. In August 1975 enigmatic comments by Mao Zedong 
on the classic novel Water Margin warning of the danger of capitulationism were 
published in the Chinese press, initiating yet another politically divisive 
campaign.6 On 2 September 1975, Politburo member and Director of the CC 
general office, Wang Dongxing, made a speech in Guangzhou which further 
illustrated the tenuous nature of central unity.7 
      At this juncture Deng Xiaoping appeared to believe that he had consolidated 
his position sufficiently to launch an all-out assault on his opponents.8 Despite 
being aware of the probability that the Water Margin campaign was directed at 
him personally, in talks of September and October 1975 Deng accused those behind 
the campaign of plotting against him.9 Undeterred, he pressed ahead with his 
program of all-round adjustment and economic development. Deng inspired his 
supporters by telling them not to be afraid of being knocked down a second time. 
      During the months of August, September and October 1975, Deng was busy 
overseeing the preparation of three documents which encapsulated his basic 
position. Maligned by his radical opponents as the "three poisonous weeds", the 
 documents were entitled "On the General Program of Work for the Whole Party 
 and the Whole Country", "Some Problems in Accelerating Industrial 
 Development" (or the "20 Points") and "On Some Problems in the Fields of 
 Science and Technology".!0 Earlier in the year Deng had established the groups 
 responsible for the drafting of these documents, listened to reports on their 
 progress and issued instructions to guide the labours of his subordinates, who 
 included Hu Yaobang, Hu Qiaomu and Deng Liqun.U In addition to proposing 
 policies which were directly counterposed to those inspired by the Cultural 
 Revolution, the General Program and the "20 points" in particular conducted an 
 open debate with the radical mobilizers. The two documents took up many issues 
 which had been raised in the campaign to study the theory of the dictatorship of 
 the proletariat, especially in the articles published by Zhang Chunqiao and Yao 
 Wenyuan. 
      Of the senior members of the Zhejiang leadership, it was Tie Ying who took 
 up the cudgels for Deng Xiaoping in the province. On 1 September 1975 the CCP 
 ZPC called a meeting of provincial and municipal office cadres to convey central 
 directives. Tan Qilong presided over the meeting and Deputy-secretary Chen 
 Weida conveyed the contents of speeches by unnamed central leaders.12 In his 
 address. Tie affirmed the correctness of the political line and policies which had 
 been adopted at the August work conference, but he noted that implementation of 
 the policies had been uneven. He pointed out that a "resolute struggle must be 
                           CONSOLIDATION AND RENEWED INSTABILITY 231 

waged against bourgeois factionalism", and he equated the evil with revisionism 
and capitalism. Tie's formulation was the same as that used in the "20 Points", 
which had been completed on 2 September 1975, the day after Tie's speech.13 In a 
further example of the subjective and instrumental manipulation of the language 
of political campaigns. Tie declared that the theoretical study campaign [of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat] should serve "as the guide in achieving profound 
understanding of the vital significance of the struggle against bourgeois 
factionalism". 
      A Zhejiang Daily editorial of 14 September urged that the momentum be 
maintained. It applauded the changes which had occurred "in places and units 
where the leadership is strong and instructions are vigorously popularized and 
implemented". Units with this kind of leadership acted in accordance with the 
slogan of "placing daring above everything else" and "resisted factionalist 
activities". They also united former warring groups and pushed production ahead. 
However, stated the editorial, development was uneven and the pace of progress 
slow.14 Nonetheless, to prove to the outside world that the situation in Hangzhou 
had stabilized, on 8 September a Romanian party and government delegation was 
invited to visit the city. It inspected the silk complex and the brocade mill.15 
      Meanwhile, the party authorities kept up their sustained attack on those 
responsible for the upheavals of the previous period. Students and staff at Zhang 
Yongsheng's Fine Arts College held a meeting to denigrate their disgraced party 
secretary. Borrowing terminology from Deng's General Program, speakers 
criticized the "extremely incorrect tendency of certain intellectuals whose world 
outlook was not transformed and who disregarded organizational discipline, 
opposed party decisions and who despised workers and peasants and labor".16 On 
23 August representatives from the college, as well as from Weng's silk complex 
and other factories and institutions in Hangzhou, mounted the platform at a 
criticism meeting which was sponsored by the CCP HMC.17 A further "mass 
criticism meeting" was held on 14 October by the CCP HMC. There were 
unmistakable derogatory references to Weng as the self-styled "leader of 
Zhejiang's workers' movement" and the "representative of new-born forces".18 
Delegates of the silk complex also attended another criticism meeting organized by 
the HMRC on 9 September 1975.19 
      In his speech to the rally of 11 October welcoming back the five factory 
delegation from its trip to Beijing, Tie Ying proposed extensive and in-depth 
criticism of bourgeois factionalism and popularization of the silk complex's 
success in rapidly restoring production.311 Tie also used the formula which had 
been devised by Deng Xiaoping of taking Mao’s three directives (relating to 
theoretical study, stability and unity and economic development) as the guiding 
principle or "key link". Tie was making more explicit the directive issued at the 
232 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

meeting of 9 September, which had pointed out that "The series of Chairman 
Mao’s important instructions are closely related to each other and inseparable".21 
When the formulation first appeared in print remains unclear. China News 
Summary claims that it was in the People's Daily editorial of 1 October 1975.22 The 
slogan had been deliberately and cleverly collocated so as to dilute the importance 
that the radicals attached to the campaign to study the theory of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat and the associated theoretical justification for restricting bourgeois 
rights. By contrast, Deng wished to emphasize the Chairman's directives, released 
almost simultaneously with his comments on theory, relating to unity and 
economic construction and to stress the danger posed by "bourgeois factionalism' 
rather than by bourgeois rights. In his adoption of Deng's interpretation of the 
three directives Tie Ying was not alone among China's provincial leaders, but it 
was a contentious issue and he had thereby revealed his hand. 
     In mid-October the CCP ZPC held an industrial conference at which the 
delegates heard reports on the transformation of the Hangzhou silk complex and 
were urged to lead their units to catch up with the gearbox factory.23 The 
conference pointed out that control of a factory's leadership by "genuine Marxists" 
and the "working masses" would ensure the correctness of its ideological and 
political line. To overcome the influence of the "two crashthroughs", some 
enterprises were sponsoring lessons on the CCP constitution and training 
"backbone elements" of Party branches and work teams in the rudimentaries of 
leadership. The conference also exhorted party committees to protect their 
subordinate officials and to shoulder responsibility for mistakes on their behalf. It 
also demanded the strengthening of "business management", the establishment 
and improvement of rules and regulations and devotion to the urgent production 
tasks remaining in 1975. 
     A progress report on Hangzhou's industrial production at the beginning of 
November continued to endorse the example set by the silk complex and the 
gearbox works.24 Party committees in the city's factories were devoting their 
energies to training shop-floor leaders, bringing into play the "exemplary 
vanguard role of Party members, the role of veteran workers as backbone 
elements, and the role of Communist Youth League members and young workers 
as a shock force". Heavy machinery factories had sent officials and workers to the 
gearbox plant on inspection tours while the silk mills of Hangzhou had emulated 
the silk complex in restoring and raising production levels. After the disruptions 
of the first half of the year, the urgency of the race to meet annual targets was 
indicated by the passage in the report which praised employees and leaders at 
factories who 

     persist in doing all they can within the eight hours and still make more 
     contributions after the eight hours. They seek no personal fame or gain. 
                           CONSOLIDATION AND RENEWED INSTABILITY 233 

      fear no fatigue of getting dirty [sic], are unmindful about hours of pay, 
      actively take part in voluntary labour, and strive to fulfil production 
      tasks. 

      A mass meeting of 40,000 party members, which was called by the CCP HMC 
on 22 November, reviewed recent progress and the arduous tasks that lay ahead.25 
 In his report to the assembled CCP members, 1st Secretary Zhang Zishi hailed the 
 achievements of the previous three months and announced that industrial 
 production in the city in the third quarter of 1975 had increased by 21.4% over the 
 preceding quarter. Zhang complimented the city's party organizations and citizens 
 for their exposure and criticism of "the crimes committed by individual bad 
 elements and bourgeois factionalism". Representatives of party members at both 
Weng's silk complex and Xia Genfa's oxygen generator plant addressed the 
 gathering. 
      However, by the end of the year a pronounced shift in provincial propaganda 
 had begun. The waning of Deng Xiaoping’s star late in 1975 was immediately 
 reflected in Zhejiang. For example, at the beginning of December 1975 Wenzhou 
 announced a production increase of 10.97% for October over September and a 
 staggering 48% increase for the first twenty days of November over October. The 
 authorities attributed the production slump earlier in the year to the "interference 
 of bourgeois factionalism" which had enabled "a handful of class enemies [to 
 engage] in sabotage for a long time". It was revealed in the stinging rebuke directed 
 toward it that the former leadership had badly handled the crisis and even 
 abdicated its responsibility: "cowardice and flinching means giving up leadership 
 and runs counter to the Party's basic line".26 Yet a mere two days later the 
 commentary published in the Zhejiang Daily concerning Wenzhou's economy 
 signalled an abrupt change in direction by stating simplistically, and in 
 terminology not used for over a year, that "once class struggle is grasped, all 
 problems can be solved".27 Bourgeois factionalism and economic problems, issues 
 which had featured in the report of 1 December, had abruptly disappeared from 
 the media. 
      After his appearance in Hangzhou on 13 November 1975 at the provincial 
 militia work meeting28 Tie Ying again dropped from public visibility until his 
reemergence at the provincial memorial service for Mao Zedong, ten months 
later. At a meeting on Christmas Day 1975, at which the three most senior 
members of the ZPC secretariat. Tan Qilong, Tie and Lai Keke, were all 
conspicuous by their absence, Luo Yi, a protege of Zhang Chunqiao, delivered the 
principal speech.29 Luo summed up 1975 as the year in which the provincial party 
had taken "class struggle as the key link" and proposed a continuation of this 
political line for the coming year. Luo's words were a patent revision of the 
assessment which had been made only the previous month. 
234 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

      The victory-reporting rally convened by the municipal authorities on 5 
January 1976 confirmed this shift, albeit in somewhat less forthright terms.30 Over 
300 units in the municipality reported their production figures for 1975, and these 
figures showed that industrial production had risen by 30% in the final quarter of 
the year.31 Production successes in 1975 were now attributed to the policy of taking 
class struggle as the key link and the criticism of revisionism and capitalism and 
were viewed as contributing to the defence and development of "the fruits of the 
Cultural Revolution". "The strengthening of leadership by the Party" was offset by 
the accompanying qualification that it "must be unified with the free launching of 
the masses".32 For Hangzhou and the whole of Zhejiang, the orientation for 1976 
henceforward revolved around class struggle. 
      A factor which mitigated the severity of the 1976 campaign to reverse Deng's 
policies of mid to late 1975 emerged as a consequence of the National Conference 
to Learn from Dazhai in agriculture, held from 15 September until 19 October 1975 
in Beijing and Shanxi province. The major speakers at the lengthy conference 
were Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Qing and Hua Guofeng and their speeches accurately 
reflected their respective views of socialism. Only Hua’s report was published in 
China at the time.33 In it Hua advocated agricultural mechanization and 
strengthening of the powers and economic importance of brigades and communes 
at the expense of production teams. Taiwan sources reported that Jiang Qing, in 
her speech at the conference, had appealed for the class mobilization of the 
peasants.34 Hua and the Cultural Revolution radicals thus agreed on the goals but 
not on the means of rural social policies.35 
      Deng Xiaoping addressed the conference on the opening day and again on 27 
September and 4 October.36 In the speeches Deng pursued his theme of 
rectification or consolidation (g$j[i). Deng stated that Mao had talked about 
rectification in the PLA, the localities, industry, agriculture, commerce, culture 
and education, science and technology and the arts and he stressed that the key to 
its success lay in the party, especially in its leading groups at the county level. 
Leading cadres had the duty to 

      discover a good young successor (0 gg ^-) and promote him step by 
      step, quickening the process somewhat, so that he stays on one grade 
      for only a year or so.37 

In a speech which he had delivered in August 1975, Deng had advocated the 
selection of cadres with practical experience, aged in their forties and fifties or 
even younger, to take up responsible positions.33 In Zhejiang two followers of 
the central radicals, Lai Keke and Luo Yi, in a document which they prepared in 
1976, denounced the application of Deng's "theory of steps" (£ to the 
province.39 In this, they were probably taking their cue from a critique published 
in the Peoples Daily in March 1976.40 Deng's advocacy of rapid promotion for 
                           CONSOLIDATION AND RENEWED INSTABILITY 235 

people of talent sounded suspiciously similar to the "helicopter" promotion of 
Cultural Revolution rebels, much decried by veteran cadres such as Deng himself. 
Several years later, Deng was at pains to distinguish between the two approaches 
to promotion, but his argument was not persuasive.41 In fact, Deng’s methods 
were essentially the same; only his criteria for selection differed. 
      On 29 October 1975 the CCP ZPC convened a meeting to announce the 
decisions which had been taken at the national Dazhai conference. Luo Yi, who 
had led the Zhejiang delegation to Beijing and Dazhai, spoke of his impressions. 
Then Tie Ying, who seemed to have become acting head of the CCP ZPC, issued 
instructions on follow-up action.42 Tie continued to hammer home the evils of 
factionalism -- a topic absent from Luo's speech -- and of capitalism, which he 
 defined as the commission of corrupt and criminal offences. While Luo praised 
 the open-door style of party rectification carried out in the county where Dazhai 
 was located. Tie seemed to favour an in-house procedure conducted behind closed 
 doors and restricted to members of the CCP. The two different approaches to party 
 rectification were another dividing line between radical and more orthodox 
policies toward organizational issues.43 
      The major decision relayed at the provincial meeting concerned the despatch 
of work teams to the countryside to propagate the spirit of the Dazhai conference. 
One hundred thousand people attended meetings in Hangzhou on 12 November 
 1975 to send off the first group totalling 9,000 team members.44 In addition to 
office cadres, the teams contained workers, teachers and students. Tie Ying, in his 
speech at the rally, announced that the total number of cadres and other staff in 
Zhejiang who had been allocated for the assignment was 30,000 and included 
several standing committee members of the ZPC. He ordered work team members 
to remain at their posts in the countryside and forbade their work units from 
recalling them to urban areas. 
      It was later reported that 40,000 cadres went to the countryside in late 1975.45 
In all, it was claimed that 80% of office cadres in Hangzhou had left their desks, 
leaving behind a only skeleton staff to man the telephones. It is possible that 
younger "rebel" cadres comprised the bulk of the work team members, effectively 
removing them from the locus of power in the province.46 The prolonged absence 
from Hangzhou of younger cadres sympathetic to the rebel cause perhaps served 
to weaken the impact of the 1976 leftist upsurge in Zhejiang and deprived the 
rebel leaders Zhang Yongsheng and He Xianchun of potential allies for their last 
battle with the "capitalist-roaders" of the province.47 

The Leftist Attack on the July 1975 Decisions, January - September 1976 

      The campaign to "criticize the right deviationist wind to reverse correct 
verdicts", which spread to the campuses of major colleges and schools across the 
236 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

country in January 1976, operationalized the renewal of the politics of 
mobilization.48 The campaign began as a result of letters written to Mao by the 
party leaders of Qinghua University in August and October 1975. The letters 
reportedly took Chi Qun and Xie Jingyi to task for their failings both ideologically 
and morally. Mao, with the encouragement of his nephew and court mediator 
Mao Yuanxin, took the letters as evidence of an attempt to reverse the verdict on 
the Cultural Revolution in the sphere of education. The younger Mao said to his 
uncle: 

      "I pay great attention to [Deng] Xiaoping’s talks and I feel there is a 
      problem. He very rarely refers to the achievements of the Cultural 
      Revolution or criticizes Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line." "As for the three 
      directives as the key link -- really there is only one directive, pushing 
      production forward". "How should the Cultural Revolution be seen? ... 
      Should it be affirmed or negated?"49 

      On 3 November Mao's directives, which in effect affirmed his nephew's 
fears, were relayed back to Qinghua university. In late November, on the 
Chairman's instructions, the Politburo convened a notification (fj Of) 
meeting at which Hua Guofeng delivered the main speech which had been vetted 
by the feeble Mao. On 26 November the speech was relayed to a meeting of 
provincial first secretaries. From then until Deng's disappearance from public life 
in January 1976, the Politburo criticized Deng at a series of meetings. On 5 February 
1976, a central document notified the party and citizens of Mao's opinions.50 
      In that same month the CC, at Mao's suggestion, held a meeting in Beijing to 
set down the guidelines and parameters for the campaign to be launched against 
Deng.51 Hua Guofeng had been appointed acting Premier and Deng's replacement 
in supervising the daily work of the CCP CC on 21 and 28 January 1976 
respectively.52 In another important decision at this time, the Commander of the 
Beijing Military Region, Chen Xilian, was appointed to take charge of the daily 
work of the CC MAC. Chen replaced Ye Jianying in this post due, it is claimed, to 
Ye's ill-health.53 On 25 February, Hua Guofeng delivered a speech to the meeting 
in which he accused Deng of having dismissed young cadres and replaced them 
with unrepentant capitalist-roaders. In a direct reference to the events in 
Hangzhou of the previous year, Hua described Deng's exertions from July to 
September as the repression of the revolutionary masses and of different points of 
view. Ironically, Deng was shouldered with the responsibility for forming factions 
and provoking conflicts such as the "Hangzhou Incident".54 
      Jiang Qing also spoke at the conference, which seems to have run from about 
20 February until early March 1976.55 On 2 March she convened a meeting of 
representatives from twelve provinces in which she accused Deng of being a "big 
traitor" and the "representative of international capitalists". On 16 February the 
                           CONSOLIDATION AND RENEWED INSTABILITY 237 

CCP CC had approved and circulated a CC MAC report which described Deng and 
Ye's speeches to the June-July 1975 enlarged plenum of the CC MAC as mistaken 
and ordered all units to stop studying and implementing them.56 
      The changes at the center immediately impacted on Zhejiang. The previous 
chapter, in discussing the leadership changes which had been agreed on by the 
Politburo in mid-1975, commented that Deng Xiaoping had failed to install a new 
leading body in Zhejiang that met his leadership criteria. The hand of the radical 
mobilizers was seen in several appointments. Of the new appointees, only Lii 
Jianguang and perhaps Feng Ke would have satisfied Deng, and they were far 
from being the most senior members of the new provincial elite. The 
disappearance of Tan Qilong after September and more importantly of Tie Ying 
after November 1975, particularly when the latter had done his utmost between 
July and November to implement central instructions, further weakened the 
leadership of Zhejiang. Tie Ying's outspoken support for Deng Xiaoping's 
program was most probably the reason behind his forced withdrawal from the 
provincial political scene. Now, with Deng himself sidelined once again, the 
central radicals were able to promote party leaders who were more attuned to the 
new direction being pursued by Beijing. 
      After his promotion in July 1975, Lai Keke had left Zhejiang for Guangzhou 
to recover from an illness.57 He returned to Hangzhou in January 1976 at a most 
politically opportune moment and reported in writing to Wang Hongwen that 
"because many leaders of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee are sick I have 
already started to take up some work". Lai immediately called for a temporary 
freeze on all appointments and dismissals in the province and reportedly set aside 
the new leading group of the ZPC Organization Department, headed by Feng Ke. 
In February 1976, Lai was presented with the opportunity to play a more active 
role in provincial affairs. 
      When he visited the Zhejiang delegation at the February Beijing meeting, 
Wang Hongwen praised Lai Keke and criticized Tan Qilong and Tie Ying. He 
verbally appointed Lai to take charge of the CCP ZPC and Luo Yi to handle routine 
administrative tasks. In the absence of Tan Qilong and Tie Ying from the political 
scene in 1976 Lai assumed leadership of the CCP ZPC. Between 9 April and 12 
October 1976 he made sixteen public appearances in Hangzhou 58 Whether Lai's 
promotion was due to Tan and Tie's ill-health or to Wang Hongwen's initiative 
remains a moot point. If Tan and Tie were not well enough to assume their 
responsibilities, Lai was the natural choice to deputize for them as he was the next 
most senior member of the ZPC standing committee. Similarly, Luo Yi, who was 
the most senior civilian cadre after Lai Keke, would have been expected to stand 
in as Lai's deputy. Although Tie did not appear in public for most of 1976, by mid¬ 
year his health had permitted him to resume duty.59 With Tie's return to public 
238 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

life at Mao's funeral service in Hangzhou, and from that time until Lai's purge in 
October 1976, the provincial press consistently listed Tie's name before Lai's, 
indicating correct seniority. However, in an unusual but possibly deliberate 
gesture, Xinhua listed Lai before Tie in its round-up of provincial mourning 
services for the Chairman.60 
      Lai and Luo drew up a summary of the Beijing discussions entitled "Our 
initial views on the symposium" ftJ/L 
ff}£), in which they distanced themselves from responsibility for 
implementing the July 1975 decisions. Lai and Luo wrote that leaders such as Tie 
Ying, who had loyally carried out central directives, had been influenced by a 
"reactionary outlook" and had "suppressed new-born socialist things". Previous 
criticism of bourgeois factionalism was described as "not stressing the principal 
contemporary contradiction", and "arbitrarily treating issues as a matter of 
principle"^ _t. £$)• The two newly-appointed leaders characterized the study 
classes held by the ZPC for leaders of factional groups, as "wrong" and "hurting 
the comrades". In criticizing the decisions of 1975 Lai and Luo were writing in the 
knowledge that they had powerful central backing for their position. 
      Upon their return to Hangzhou, Lai and Luo called a work meeting of the 
ZPC to inform its members of the new leadership arrangements and the strategy 
for another potentially destabilizing political campaign.61 At the conference, a 
leading cadre of the CCP HMC lobbied to collect signatures for a petition to be sent 
to Beijing, requesting that Tan and Tie return to Zhejiang to answer questions 
about the direction in which they had led the provincial committee in the latter 
half of 1975. The cadre in question also withdrew the self-criticism that he had 
made the previous July, confessing only too truthfully that "I could only speak 
like that, otherwise I wouldn't have got through. There was no alternative".62 In 
the constant see-saw of political fortunes, the balance had again tipped to one side, 
flinging off or reseating players in the process. 
      Lai and Luo focused their dissatisfaction regarding the July 1975 decisions on 
four major issues: they equated criticism of bourgeois factionalism with the 
suppression of "socialist new born forces”; the study classes which had been held 
for core members of the "mountain top" faction were described as being "wrong 
from their guiding ideology down to their concrete methods"; the adjustment to 
leading groups was characterized as "allowing people who haven’t changed in the 
Cultural Revolution to grab power"; and finally, the freeze placed on the 
unorthodox methods in recruiting party members and promoting cadres was 
viewed as an attack on new cadres.60 
      In a repetition of the tactics which had been used to such effect in late 1973, a 
follower of Weng Senhe from the silk complex led a group to storm the 
 provincial work meeting and occupy the living quarters of representatives from 
                           CONSOLIDATION AND RENEWED INSTABILITY 239 

the eight factories.64 Qiu Qiang, Deputy-secretary of the CCP HMC, reportedly 
described the leading group of six members who had been appointed to the 
Zhejiang Hemp Mill in 1975 as capitalist-roaders, and declared that the group 
should be dissolved. In response to this signal, rebels in the mill took away the 
group's seal of authority and locked the mill's administrative offices. By these 
measures the rebels hoped to obtain the recall of cadres who had been transferred 
or demoted in July 1975.65 
      The "eight factories' experience" also came under fire as a "revisionist 
model". The "reversal of verdicts" originated in Wang Hongwen's ambivalence 
on the issue. In conjunction with Ji Dengkui Wang had been instrumental in 
establishing the model in July 1975. Even in December 1975 and January 1976 he 
had continued to support it and requested that the CCP ZPC write a statement to 
this effect and issue it so that "the situation will develop even better”. In February 
1976, Wang seemed to fudge his position by pleading ignorance of developments 
since his investigations in Hangzhou. In the following month Lai and Luo 
reportedly refused permission for Zhejiang Daily to publish the silk complex's 
production figures for February. News of this decision quickly spread around 
Hangzhou and confidence in the direction in which the eight factories had been 
heading was thereby shaken and eventually shattered.66 
      During their seven-month ascendancy in Zhejiang, Lai Keke and Luo Yi 
made strenuous efforts to secure the province for their patrons in Beijing. Most 
notably, they took advantage of the outburst of mourning for the deceased Zhou 
Enlai which erupted in April 1976, to attempt to track down and arrest those 
responsible for Hangzhou's Qingming incident.67 Lai also assiduously endorsed 
the thesis propagated by the radicals concerning the formation of capitalist-roaders 
inside the CCP. His espousal of the theory assisted the Cultural Revolution 
radicals in Beijing in their effort to widen the scope of the campaign against Deng 
Xiaoping, so as to include his supporters in leading positions across the country. 
Naturally many veteran cadres resisted the trend, hoping instead to limit the 
campaign to a perfunctory denunciation of the dismissed Deng. 
      To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the publication of the May 16 Circular, 
on 15 May 1976 the provincial party committee held a celebration rally in 
Hangzhou. In his speech to the assembled crowd, Lai Keke quoted Mao from the 
May 16 Circular as his authority for the view that representatives of the 
bourgeoisie existed in provincial departments, thus wishing to legitimize a purge 
of cadres in the province.6® The day after the rally, the ZPC propaganda 
department called a symposium to discuss the question of the existence of a 
bourgeoisie inside the Communist Party. The seminar lasted nine days and was 
attended by full-time propaganda workers, worker-peasant-soldier theorists and 
grassroots cadres, numbering eighty in all69 One week after the conclusion of the 
240 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

symposium, the ZPC convened a report meeting to listen to speeches from some 
of the forum's participants. Lai Keke delivered an address on behalf of the 
provincial authorities.70 
      On 1 July, in a speech at the meeting called to celebrate the 55th anniversary 
of the CCP, Lai adopted a more conciliatory tone toward "comrades" who had 
made mistakes under the influence of Deng's revisionist line. He urged them to 
heighten their political consciousness and adopt the correct attitude toward the 
Cultural Revolution, the masses and themselves, and take practical steps to rectify 
 their errors. Nevertheless, Lai reiterated his determination that Zhejiang would 
carry out a protracted struggle against the bourgeoisie both inside and outside the 
party.7* Several days later, when the ZPMD held a meeting to discuss the problem 
of capitalist-roaders inside the CCP, it concluded, unlike the ZPC, that the majority 
of cadres were good.72 
      Apart from displaying excessive zeal in publicly aligning himself with the 
Gang of Four, Lai kept up a sustained attack on the decisions of July 1975. His most 
 savage and comprehensive onslaught appeared in an article which was published 
 on the eve of the arrest of the Gang of Four. Written on the basis of the speech 
 that Lai had delivered on 28 September 1976, it appeared in the Zhejiang Daily on 
30 September. The article achieved such notoriety that it was compared with the 
 Guangming Daily article of 4 October 1976, penned by the writing team known as 
Liang Xiao and published under the instructions of Yao Wenyuan. Like Liang 
 Xiao's piece, Lai's article was later designated a "mobilizational order for a 
 counter-revolutionary coup" and a "clarion call to support the Gang of Four’s plot 
 to seize power".73 
      The background to the publication of Lai's article deserves mention. At a 
 meeting of the standing committee of the ZPC on 25 September 1976, Lai Keke had 
 reportedly suggested that the ZPC convene a criticism meeting against Deng 
 Xiaoping before National Day and he volunteered to speak at such a meeting. 
 However, Lai supposedly refused to show the outline of his speech to the standing 
 committee for its advance approval. The meeting took place on 28 September with 
 Tie Ying delivering the concluding speech on behalf of the ZPC.74 Lai Keke also 
 addressed the gathering, together with the peasant leaders Jiang Ruwang from 
 Jinjian brigade, Wang Jinyou from Shangwang brigade, Li Jinrong from Nanbao 
 brigade and representatives of offices and factories in the province.75 Tie delivered 
 the regulation denunciation of the arch-villain Deng Xiaoping and made it clear 
 that the criticism should focus on Deng himself and should be carried out under 
 the leadership of the CCP. Tie stressed that 

      It is not allowed to establish ties and to build mountain-strongholds 
      under any pretext and any form; it is not allowed to organize fighting 
      groups. 
                           CONSOLIDATION AND RENEWED INSTABILITY 241 

     Lai Keke reportedly modified the contents of his speech for publication and 
then submitted it to the Zhejiang Daily without the prior knowledge or approval 
of the provincial party committee's standing committee.76 However, the decision 
to publish Lai's article presumably could not have occurred without the consent of 
this body, of which Tie was the senior ranking cadre. On 8 October 1976 Lai sent a 
copy to Wang Hongwen in the hope of gaining kudos for himself 
U# )77 apparently unaware of Wang's arrest two days before. Lai did 
not pull any punches in the article.78 He accused Deng Xiaoping of having 
repeatedly issued instructions in July, September and October of 1975, presumably 
to the Zhejiang party leadership, to 

      give a free hand in mobilizing the people, criticize bourgeois 
      factionalism and carry out a mass self-educational movement to 
      overcome bourgeois factionalism.79 ... Deng Xiaoping used opposition 
      to bourgeois factionalism as a pretext for reversing the verdict on the 
      Cultural Revolution,80 settling accounts with it in a vain attempt to 
      bloodily suppress the proletarian revolutionary faction, and 
      unrestrainedly encircling and suppressing the revolutionary faction as 
      he and Liu Shaoqi had done in the early days of the Cultural 
      Revolution. He carried out a white terror and labelled a large group of 
      revolutionary rebels "anti-party elements" and "counter¬ 
      revolutionaries" in order to annihilate the proletariat's aspirations 
      0±^) and boost the arrogance (j£ jxl.) of the bourgeoisie. How 
      pernicious! 

      Lai Keke described the equation of bourgeois factionalism with revisionism 
and capitalism, a formula used both in Deng's 20 Points and speeches by Tie Ying 
in September 1975, as "theoretically absurd and politically reactionary". He 
complained that the mass meetings which had been held between August and 
October 1975 to criticize bourgeois factionalism had labelled some cadres and 
sections of the masses as 

      "anti-party, power-usurping restorationists", "Song Jiang-type 
      capitulationists",82 and "restorationists under the signboard of 
      opposing restoration" -- thus treating everything as a matter of 
      principle and seriously confusing the two different kinds of 
      contradictions .... 

The establishment of study classes had also been an error, wrote Lai, and he 
requested that the members of such classes return to their units and positions, an 
instruction which in effect rehabilitated the followers of Zhang Yongsheng, Weng 
Senhe and He Xianchun. If their original units remained in existence, he 
continued, in an allusion to the dissolved militia headquarters, workers’ congress 
and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, appropriate work should be found 
for the study class members on their return. 
242 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

      Turning his attention to the reorganization of leading groups, Lai attacked 
 Deng for trying to discredit the "proletarian revolutionary faction" by associating it 
with Lin Biao, a charge to which they were clearly vulnerable and therefore ultra¬ 
 sensitive. Lai argued that Deng had directed his fire at "those revolutionary 
 leading cadres who had united in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution" and 
 had later played an active role in the 1974 campaign against Lin Biao and 
 Confucius. Here, he was referring to himself (although he does not seem to have 
 been very active in the campaign -- see chapter seven) and other provincial and 
 municipal leaders such as Wang Zida, Shen Ce and Wang Shichuan. With the 
 exception of Lai, these officials shared similar career patterns in the Cultural 
 Revolution. In 1966-67 they had deserted or betrayed their fellow leaders when 
 under attack from the rebels; in late 1967 they had recanted and been allowed to 
 join revolutionary committees as "revolutionary leading cadres"; in 1973-74 they 
 had caved in to or gone along with the demands put forward the "mountain top" 
 faction leaders in their rebellion and destabilization of party authority and 
 connived at or participated in their factional activities; and in July 1975 they had 
 been dismissed or transferred. Lai correctly judged that Deng viewed 
 "revolutionary leading cadres" as thorns in his side and had set out 
 to dismiss them so as to make way for the establishment of "restorationist, 
 capitalist leading groups". Although Deng Xiaoping had been the cause of the 
 problems in Zhejiang's since July 1975, responsibility for the implementation of 
 the incorrect line, added Lai, rested with the provincial leadership. Lai’s withering 
 critique of the July 1975 decisions made no direct mention of the PLA's role in the 
 factories of Hangzhou except for the reference to the bloody suppression of the 
 "proletarian revolutionary faction", which was perhaps an allusion to the military 
 occupation of industrial units. 
      Overall, Lai's article provided important first-hand evidence of how a 
 leading member of the losing side in the political struggles in Zhejiang viewed the 
 events of July 1975. Deng Xiaoping had delivered a severe blow to the fortunes of 
 the rebel faction and their allies in the provincial and municipal party leaderships, 
 but the fact that Lai had been promoted in the 1975 reshuffle was eloquent 
 testimony to the incompleteness of Deng's victory. Factors external to and larger 
 than issues of a provincial nature determined the final settlement of the Zhejiang 
 problem. 

 Aftermath, 1976-199083 

       One western analyst of provincial affairs, writing in 1976, observed that the 
 problems in Zhejiang were rife and protracted, and that changes in its provincial 
 party secretariat were "likely to become ultimately necessary".84 The provincial 
 authorities also admitted at the time that factionalism had seriously afflicted 
                           CONSOLIDATION AND RENEWED INSTABILITY 243 

cadres and citizens alike. A report of the planning meeting which was held by the 
ZPRC in September 1976 included the following passage: 

      As for the differences of opinion and lack of mutual understanding 
      among certain cadres and masses, ... these were instigated by capitalist- 
      roaders like Liu Shaoqi, Lin Biao and Deng Xiaoping. It was necessary to 
      do meticulous ideological and political work among these people and 
      to urge them not to squabble endlessly over past grudges, but to unite to 
      criticize Deng Xiaoping.85 

      This and the previous chapter of this study have argued that the leadership 
 arrangements decided upon in 1975 and born out of compromise were provisional 
 and shaky at best. The arrest of the Gang of Four illustrated the truth of this 
 assessment. Lai Keke and Luo Yi were removed from office as agents of the Gang 
 of Four and their whole political careers subjected to a highly damaging analysis 
 in which mud-slinging and name-calling featured prominently.86 Senior cadres 
 who had been transferred from the province such as Wang Zida, Wang Xing and 
 Shen Ce were later ordered back to Zhejiang to account more fully for their past 
 misdeeds. 
      Tan Qilong never returned to Zhejiang and in 1977 was appointed 1st 
 Secretary of Qinghai province in the backward north-west of China. Tan’s transfer 
 was a definite demotion but he bounced back again in 1980 when he was 
 promoted to the province of Sichuan, initially as 2nd Secretary and then as 1st 
 Secretary of the provincial party committee, replacing his illustrious predecessor 
 Zhao Ziyang. In March 1977 Tie Ying was appointed 1st Secretary of the CCP ZPC 
 and held that position until March 1983, parting ways with Deng Xiaoping over 
major policy initiatives which were launched at the 11th CC's 3rd plenum in 
 December 1978.87 Wang Fang, who had been involved in the 1967-68 factional 
battles in Wenzhou, was selected to replace Tie, who was appointed to the largely 
honorific but high profile post of Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Advisory 
Commission, a post he held until December 1988. When Wang was transferred to 
 Beijing early in 1987 to become Minister of Public Security, he was succeeded by 
 another of Jiang Hua's proteges from the pre-Cultural Revolution, Xue Ju. Xue 
held this post until the end of 1988, when, at the CCP 8th Zhejiang Provincial 
Congress, he retired to the "second line" and was replaced by the outsider Li 
Zemin.88 
      Commander of the ZPMD, Zhang Wenbi, and Zhang Zishi, 1st Secretary of 
 the CCP HMC, disappeared from public life in Zhejiang in April 1978, but for very 
different reasons. Zhang Wenbi became advisor to the Nanjing Military Region 
and retired in September 1982. Zhang Zishi was removed from office and ordered 
to give a full account of his activities in the Cultural Revolution in Shandong, or 
face the possibility of death.89 He now lives in retirement in Hangzhou. In mid- 
244 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

1979 Chen Wenshu, 2nd Secretary of the CCP HMC, also lost his post. Thus, when 
Deng gained greater control over the power of appointment in the late 1970s, he 
did not hesitate to retire or dismiss cadres whom he had been forced to accept in 

1975. 
       The person at the center of the factional rivalry between United Headquarters 
and Red Storm, Jiang Hua, survived his cathartic experience in the Cultural 
Revolution to fight another day. In January 1975 Jiang was appointed President of 
the Supreme Court at the 4th NPC, a post he retained until his retirement in 1983. 
During his eight years as China's most senior judge, Jiang presided over the 1980- 
81 trial of the Gang of Four and the military officers associated with Lin Biao. The 
propriety of Jiang sitting at this trial remains open to grave doubt. After all, he had 
lost his position as First Secretary of a provincial party committee largely due to 
 the actions of the followers of those who faced him in the court. His wife had 
 committed suicide under pressure from the same followers of the accused. Jiang 
would have been less than human if he did not relish the occasion to gain 
 revenge for his political disgrace and the death of his wife. When Jiang's wife Wu 
 Zhonglian was posthumously rehabilitated in 1978, Tan Zhenlin and Jiang Hua 
 attended the memorial service in Beijing. The report commented that "we are 
 finally able to redress the injustice done to her and clear her name". Wu's ashes 
 were deposited at Babaoshan in Beijing.90 
       Leading party cadres lost their posts in the political fallout that followed the 
 defeat of the radical cause in China, but they were spared the fate that befell the 
 three rebel leaders Zhang Yongsheng, Weng Senhe and He Xianchun. In the 
 initial months after the arrest of the Gang of Four, Zhang carried on his crusade 
 against the Zhejiang party leadership from Beijing with impunity. It was probably 
 the letter he wrote in February 1977 criticizing the leaders of the ZPC, that stirred 
 the authorities into action. Zhang was brought back to Zhejiang in March 1977 to 
 face the consequences. He was formally arrested in August 1978 and, on 4 April 
 1979, a bespectacled, shaven Zhang Yongsheng was sentenced to life 
 imprisonment and permanent deprivation of his political rights. 
       Weng Senhe was among the first of the Gang of Four's supporters in the 
 provinces to be publicly identified in the Chinese media. In December 1976, on the 
 same day that Hua Guofeng named Weng in his speech to the 2nd National 
 Conference on Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture,91 the CCP ZPC arrested 
 Weng, dismissed him from his posts and expelled him from the CCP. By then, 
 Weng had already been held in detention for eighteen months. He remained 
 unrepentant at his trial, which was conducted in August 1978, and was sentenced 
 to life imprisonment,92 perhaps being fortunate to have escaped a harsher 
 penalty.93 He Xianchun deprived the authorities of the satisfaction of putting him 
 on trial by slashing his wrists in prison in late 1976 or early 1977. Even after their 
                                CONSOLIDATION AND RENEWED INSTABILITY 245 

imprisonment Zhang and Weng were yet to face their harshest trial. In 1984 the 
two men, together with recalcitrant political activists and criminal recidivists, 
were sent to the Qinghai salt-plains to labor in permanent internal exile. 
However, due to his advancing years (he is now over fifty), in late 1988 Weng was 
brought back to Zhejiang to serve out his sentence. Weng and He's trusted 
lieutenants, Huang Yintang and Xia Genfa were tried in April 1979 and both 
received two-year suspended death sentences.94 
       The fate of the leaders of Red Storm and the "mountain base" faction varied. 
For his efforts in standing up to the "mountain top" faction, Zhang Jifa was 
elected Vice-chairman of the provincial trade union council at its 7th Congress in 
August 1978. There he joined Guo Zhisong and Fang Jianwen, other prominent 
leaders of the "mountain base" faction. In an ironic twist of fate not uncommon 
in China, Fang Jianwen was sentenced to two years' jail in 1983 for a case of bribery 
involving the sum of 2,000 yuan.95 in 1965, before his rebellion in the Cultural 
Revolution, Fang had been accused of a similar offence. After four years in prison, 
the Wenzhou rebel leader of Rebel General HQ, Yao Guolin, was released in 1978 
and rehabilitated by the provincial party authorities. One of Weng Senhe's 
principal protagonists at the silk mill, Shen Chuyun, was appointed party secretary 
of the complex in October 1977.96 She was later promoted to the post of Deputy¬ 
secretary of Hangzhou's Shangcheng District (_h^ [X). In 1985 Shen was 
disciplined for wasting 13,000 yuan of state funds in a five-day orgy of wining and 
dining, making the sums allegedly embezzled by Weng over a period of five years 
appear insignificant by comparison.97 The Red Guard leader from Zhejiang 
University, Liu Ying, died of illness in 1980 at the age of 37. 
       Deng Xiaoping was correct in stating that the question of leadership would 
determine the success of his policies in Zhejiang. His failure to achieve this goal 
in July 1975 reflected the balance of power in the Politburo and his need to 
compromise. Compromise at the center meant instability in the provinces, a point 
made by Dorothy Solinger in her study of factional politics in Yunnan province 
during the years 1967-80. Solinger wrote that 

       Local turmoil has been highest in those years when central leaders as a 
       group have failed to settle decisively on one local leader or faction, 
       either intentionally ... or because the central government itself has been 
       severely divided (as in the mid-1970s).98 

       The extraordinary events of July 1975 in Zhejiang were the culmination of 
factional struggles which had continued almost unchecked for almost a decade, 
resulting at times in the paralysis of the local administration. Intriguingly, the 
CCP ZPC has reassessed many cases and incidents which occurred in the "ten years 
of disorder" but has up to now not declared its stand on the July 1975 decisions. 
This is possibly due to the fact that the decisions were carried out at a time when 
246 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

Deng Xiaoping was in charge of the CCP CC but also during the ten years of 
disaster", about which the current leadership has recorded its negative judgment. 
Additionally, the two emissaries of the CCP CC who went to Zhejiang to 
investigate and report on the trouble were two politicians who have since been 
purged from the national political scene. In 1979, factory cadres at the No. 1 cotton 
mill told me that they believed that the decisions taken four years previously had 
been correct, but they spoke defensively and as if many people believed otherwise. 
      The resort to the use of troops to quell factional disturbances was an 
admission that all other avenues to a settlement were closed." Even the radical 
central leaders were forced to accept the necessity for the drastic step and, as in 
Shanghai in 1966-67, had shown that they were prepared to use violence to 
suppress their opponents. Factionalism and rebellion had its limits, even for those 
whose political careers were intimately linked with the concepts both in theory 
and practice.

               Beijing where, together with other provincial leaders, he was informed of the arrest of the 

               four radical central leaders and shown the slip of paper allegedly handed to Hiw Guofeng by 

               Mao Zedong in April 1976, on which Mao had written the six characters 
                            (with you in charge. I'm at ease). On October 14,1976, at a meeting of the standing 
306                CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 


                committee of the CCP ZPC, Lai expressed skepticism about the authenticity of the document, 
                saying; "I have seen the Chairman's handwriting many times. That slip 'with you in charge, 

                I'm at ease' simply does not look like his own handwriting. Furthermore, why were we 
                shown only a photocopy and not the original?" See Shen Weicai, HZRB, August 17,1977; Tie 
                Ying, HZRB, June 7, 1978; and Li Yanwu, "The downfall of the Lin-Jiang cliques-rise and fall

                ZJRB article of September 30,1975. 

      80. The current party line in China accepts this argument by stating that in 1975 Deng attempted 

                 to restore the "correct line" of the CCP's 8th Congress of 1956, which viewed the 
                 development of the economy as the principal task of the socialist revolution. See Zhonggong 
                 dangshi baiti, p. 388. The section of the 1981 Resolution of the CCP CC which referred to this 
                 period stated that "Comrade Mao Zedong could not bear to accept systematic corrections of 
                 the errors of the 'cultural revolution’ by comrade Deng Xiaoping". Resolution on CCP History

                 26,1977, SWB/FE/5657/BII/7. He came under strong criticism in October 1977 for his support

      the military should be mobilized to maintain law and order and guarantee normal 
      production, even if this meant instituting martial law. See Deng Xiaoping Wenxuan, p. 331. 
      In 1989 Deng promulgated martial law and mobilized troops to enforce it. His actions were 
      thus not entirely unpredictable.
