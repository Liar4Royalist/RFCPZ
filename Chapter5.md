                      MILITARY RULE IN ZHEJIANG, 1969-72 


      In the four and a half years which elapsed between the CCP's 9th (1969) and 
10th (1973) National Congresses, fierce political struggles continued unabated 
within the upper echelons of the party. Provincial officials became intimately 
involved in these disputes which revolved around such issues as party 
reconstruction, the role of the PLA in the political, economic and social spheres, 
 the evolution of the political institutions and groups brought into existence by the 
 Cultural Revolution, and the respective roles and relationship between military 
 cadres, civilian officials and mass organization representatives within leading 
 groups. 
      It was a period in which the ascendancy that the military had gained during 
 the years 1967-69 aroused concern among sections of the Chinese leadership, Mao 
 Zedong in particular. Various commentators have pointed to the irony of the 
 situation in which the most disciplined, unaccountable and authoritarian 
 component of the state structure was able to emerge triumphant from a political 
 movement that had, among its alleged objectives, the loosening of a constrictive 
 political system and the participation of a broader spectrum of the population in 
 the political processes.1 At the 9th Party Congress Lin Biao had been officially 
 written into the statutes of the party constitution as Mao's designated successor. 
 However, the obstructions placed in the way of party reconstruction after 1969 and 
 the political strength of regional military commanders, some of whom were loyal 
 to Lin and his central military faction, provoked the opposition of powerful 
 groups within the CCP.2 
       In Zhejiang, the new leaders of the ZPRC were overwhelmingly from a 
 military background and from military units directly answerable and loyal to their 
 central military patron, Lin Biao. Although Nan Ping, Xiong Yingtang and Chen 
 Liyun, like most officers in the Zhejiang military district, had served in the 3rd 
 Field Army before 1949 they were not senior officers. The Cultural Revolution had 
 boosted their careers and brought them directly into the political arena. These 
 military officials were less tied to the locality in which they served than any prev¬ 
  ious provincial leadership since 1949. Teiwes has tabulated this phenomenon for 
                                                 MILITARY RULE IN ZHEJIANG 93 

China's provincial-level administrations as a whole.3 
     The leadership's lack of familiarity with local conditions did not seem to 
prevent substantial economic growth in the years 1969-72. Major disturbances, 
particularly in the urban areas of the province, had disrupted industrial 
production in the years 1967 and 1968 and the recovery over the next few years 
made the province something of a national model for economic development.4 
Total agricultural and industrial output value in 1969 increased 18.1% over the 
previous year to establish an all-time provincial record. Over the following three 
years it grew at an annual rate of 11.7%, 9.5% and 11.5% respectively. In 1969, the 
value of agricultural output reached its highest level since 1964. Substantial 
increases in the value of industrial output of 30%, 16.2%, 15.4% and 10.2% occurred 
over the years 1969-72.5 
      This chapter, more than anywhere else in this book, has drawn on source 
material at the national level to compensate for the dearth of contemporary 
information from Zhejiang. The paucity of sources on the politics of the province 
during these years may reflect the high degree of social control that the military 
exerted over provincial affairs and the general tightening of the flow of 
information after the leakages of sensitive material by Red Guards over the 
previous two years. Contemporary observers again commented on trends in 
Zhejiang which were unique to the province and stood it apart from other 
provinces. The notion of Zhejiang as a special case, while difficult to substantiate 
without detailed comparative information, will be noted where relevant and 
significant. 

The Lin Biao Affair, 1969-71 

      The downfall and death of Lin Biao remains one of the most disastrous and, 
despite the recent spate of publications on the affair, one of the most mysterious 
episodes in -the turbulent history of the CCP. It caused Mao Zedong great anguish 
 and was a humiliating blow to his prestige. That his recently-anointed successor 
 should plot to assassinate him and then flee the country was an indictment of 
 Mao’s judgment and a major reversal for the Cultural Revolution itself. After all, 
 Lin had emerged in the Cultural Revolution as the best and most loyal pupil of 
 the "Great Helmsman". The accumulation of a series of incidents, culminating in 
 Lin's flight in September 1971, had served gradually to alienate the Chairman 
 from his designated successor. 
      In October 1969 Lin first aroused Mao's suspicions about his ambitions when 
 he issued Order No. 1 at a time following bloody clashes between the Soviet and 
 Chinese forces on the disputed Manchurian border.6 Lin's order of 17 October 1969 
 had two aims, according to one of its targets, Marshall Nie Rongzhen.7 First, Lin 
 was testing the ground for a coup by creating an exaggerated atmosphere of crisis. 
94       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 According to later accounts, all of which ascribe the meanest motives to Lin, the 
 Vice-chairman failed to inform Mao of his intentions. One source states, however, 
 that Lin's directive was based on Mao's assessment of the possibility of a 
 worsening of the international situation.8 That he acted in accordance with his 
 estimation of Mao's views seems more feasible. It is hardly likely that Lin, who 
 was renowned for his obsequiousness to the Chairman, would take such a drastic 
 step without first securing Mao's approval.9 
       According to Nie, the second objective of Lin’s order was to supply the pretext 
 for the removal of veteran PLA leaders such as himself, Chen Yi, Xu Xiangqian, 
 Liu Bocheng, Ye Jianying and Zhu De from the capital. They were ordered to 
 remain under virtual house arrest in various cities and towns in central China, in 
 almost a straight line running south from Beijing to Guangzhou. Non-military 
 party leaders such as Li Fuchun and Deng Xiaoping, and the dying Liu Shaoqi and 
 Tao Zhu, were also forced out of Beijing by this order.10 
       Chen Boda and Lin Biao further incurred Mao's ire for their persistent efforts 
 to have the position of head of state written into the revised state constitution 
 which was discussed at the 9th CCP CC's 2nd plenum (the Lushan plenum) in 
 August-September 1970. At the plenum Chen Boda, Ye Qun (Lin's wife) and Wu 
 Faxian (Commander of the Air Force) attacked Zhang Chunqiao by innuendo for 
 not praising Mao as a genius in the draft of the constitution that he had drawn up 
 and presented to the meeting for discussion.11 Mao questioned the motives of 
 those who wished to raise him to such great heights, although three years 
 previously he had exhibited no such unease about the personality cult which had 
 grown to monstrous proportions. Additionally, the Chairman suspected that the 
 restoration of the post of state Chairman was a means by which Lin, given his 
  status as successor, would consolidate his position and rectify the anomaly 
 whereby as Vice-premier and defence minister he was junior to Premier Zhou 
  Enlai in the state administration. 
       After Mao’s decisive intervention the issue was settled, but the struggle 
  continued on the ideological, political, organizational and policy fronts. Chen and 
  Lin's principal supporters in the PLA were subjected to scathing criticism at three 
  meetings which were convened between December 1970 and April 1971 — the 
  North China meeting (22 December 1970 to 24 January 1971), the CC Military 
  Affairs Commission Conference (9 January to 19 February 1971); and the report 
  meeting to "criticize Chen and rectify the style of work" (15 to 29 April 1971).12 The 
  central notice transmitted from the April session was relayed to the provinces and 
  discussed at meetings in May 1971.13 The campaign against Chen Boda described 
  him as a "sham Marxist swindler" and it gradually shifted from concentration on 
  the manifestations of anarchic politics in the Cultural Revolution to a more 
  fundamental critique of the doctrine underpinning it.14 
                                                          MILITARY RULE IN ZHEJIANG 95 

       In September 1970 immediately following the plenum, Mao moved to 
weaken Lin's power. He directed the party center to establish an Organization and 
Propaganda Group directly under the Politburo with Kang Sheng as its leader and 
Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Ji Dengkui and Li Desheng as 
members. None of Lin's close associates were thus appointed to this powerful 
body. Because of Kang Sheng's poor health and Li Desheng's involvement in 
military affairs, the Cultural Revolution civilian radicals took charge of this 
powerful super-department. It was placed in charge of the CC Organization 
Department, the Central Party School, People's Daily, Guangming Daily, Red Flag, 
Xinhua Newsagency, the Central Broadcasting Bureau, central publication and 
 translation bureaux. May 7 cadre schools and central mass organizations such as 
 the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the CYL and the Women's 
 Federation.15 
        Then, on 7 April 1971 Li Xiannian, Ji Dengkui and Zhang Caiqian were added 
 to the membership of the CC MAC Executive Group (cj=t ^ 3§I 
 £g), a body established in 1968 and hitherto dominated by supporters of Lin 
 Biao.16 Mao graphically described the series of moves as throwing stones, mixing 
 sand into soil and undermining the wall. This referred to his critical comments on 
 documents and self-examinations written by Chen Boda and Lin's military clique 
 and discussed and eventually rejected as insufficient by the MAC Conference of 
 January to February 1971; the April 1971 addition of new members to the MAC 
 Executive Group and the December 1970 reorganization of the leadership of the 
 Beijing Military Region, with Li Desheng appointed Commander and Ji Dengkui 

 2nd Political Commissar.17 
        In the twelve months between the Lushan plenum and Lin's death on the 
 Mongolian steppes, Mao turned up the heat on Lin Biao's supporters.18 Lin's 
 military followers in the province came under direct and indirect attack. In 
 Zhejiang, the 8th enlarged plenum of the ZPRC met from 23 November to 5 
 December 1970 to discuss the communique of the Lushan plenum and the 
 relevant central directives arising from it.19 A Zhejiang Daily editorial of 7 
 December entitled "Leading Cadres should study Philosophy more 
 Conscientiously" initiated the critique of Chen Boda’s "idealism" and 
 "metaphysics" in the province.20 Jinjian brigade and the Jiangshan cement works, 
 both in Jiangshan county (££ |JL|-H), south-western Zhejiang, were promoted as 
 nation-wide models in this philosophical campaign. Jiang Ruwang, (Ir&EE) 
 party secretary of Jinjian brigade, became famous for his role in the campaign, 
 which Kang Sheng for promoted as an example of peasants studying Mao Zedong 
 Thought.21 Other articles appeared in the local press in response to Mao’s request 

 for party members to study Marxism more assiduously 22 
        There is evidence at this time that Xu Shiyou, undoubtedly with the 
96       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

permission and encouragement of the center, moved to monitor and curtail the 
activities of Nan Ping and Chen Liyun in Zhejiang and thus check Lin Biao s 
influence in the region. In December 1970 the Zhejiang Production and 
Construction Corps was established under the command of the Nanjing Military 
Region.23 The leaders of this newly-established corps, whose task was to employ 
educated youth and demobilized soldiers on major construction projects, were 
Political Commissar Xia Qi (gift), who also was appointed Deputy Political 
Commissar of the ZPMD, and Commander Liu Ang ($flj ep), who was made 
Deputy-commander of the ZPMD. Xia Qi was a close protege of Xu Shiyou. 
       In an editorial published at the end of January 1971, reference was made to 
the "three onlys" concept.24 The editorial directed a thinly-veiled warning toward 
those who departed from the "three onlys" and held evil thoughts (?£:$;) 
concerning Mao's leadership, who owed allegiance to a "second leadership center" 
and who applied criteria other than Mao Zedong Thought to distinguish right 
from wrong. A contemporary observer, commenting upon these words, raised the 
possibility that reference to the second leadership center may have referred to 
supporters of Liu Shaoqi.25 Another analyst suggested that the Commander of the 
Nanjing Military Region, Xu Shiyou, was the target because of his policy 
disagreements with the central military establishment.26 In retrospect it is clear 
that the warning was directed against provincial supporters of Chen Boda and by 
implication, Lin Biao, although the editorial specifically mentioned Lin as the 
deputy-leader of the party center headed by Mao. This formula was standard 
practice at the beginning of 1971, however. 
       Chen Liyun's Unit 7350 was also subjected to criticism. A report of January 
 1971 referred pointedly to its alleged "arrogance and self-complacency" (g 
 Jjj § l^f) and inability to listen to other views (—The unit was 
advised to "promote modesty and prudence". The report continued: 

       Last year [1970], some "three support and two military" personnel of the 
       units did not fully understand die new situation, which had emerged 
       as a result of the new leap forward in socialist revolution and 
       construction.27 

 Such criticism was certainly not confined to Zhejiang28 but it was all the more 
 sudden because the provincial leadership had, over the previous two years or so, 
 blown the military’s trumpet hard and long. From 1969 to 1970 enormous praise 
 had been heaped on the PLA and effusive adulation extended to its Deputy- 
 commander Lin Biao.29 In May 1970 a conference on the work of "three support 
 and two militaries" units had praised personnel stationed at Hangzhou University 
 for their "outstanding work".30 By October 1971, after Lin Biao's demise, PLA 
 cadres performing such tasks were reminded to "strengthen their concept of the 
 Party and consciously safeguard the Party's unified leadership".31 These examples 
                                                          MILITARY RULE IN ZHEJIANG 97 

illustrate the turn in the tide of the PLA's fortunes. Intensified attacks on the PLA 
for arrogance, complacency and commandism were stepped up in the months 
immediately following Lin's disappearance.32 
      Policy issues were also involved in the elite conflict. After the 9th Congress a 
militarization of society had occurred through the mass mobilization of labor for 
rural developmental projects33 and the diversion of huge amounts of investment 
funds to the interior of the country for defence purposes.34 The provincial 
leadership in Zhejiang based its radical mobilizational rural policies on the study 
and application of Mao Zedong Thought and against the backdrop of such 
campaigns as the purification of the class ranks and the attack on capitalist 
tendencies in the countryside 35 Unlike the earlier Leap Forward of 1958-59, which 
had been directed largely by civilian party cadres and where spontaneity and mass 
initiative found some room for expression, the "flying leap" of 1969-70 was a 
guided, disciplined unleashing of human energy carefully controlled by the 
military. It was the application of political campaigns previously restricted to the 
ranks of the PLA to society at large, particularly its youth. 
       After the Lushan plenum the radical policy initiatives of 1969-70 were 
moderated and rolled back by a coalition of regional military commanders and 
 central civilian cadres. In particular, the militarization and radicalization of rural 
 policies was brought to a halt. The forthright, pugnacious Xu Shiyou in Nanjing 
 was prominent among regional military commanders who spoke out against 
 egalitarian rural distribution policies. Xu made his views known in October and 
 November 1970 and again in February 1971 36 Xu's attention may well have been 
 drawn to the fact that in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, both of which fell within 
 his jurisdiction, rural social policies were the most radical in the country. For 
 example, in Zhejiang one quarter of all brigades had taken over the important role 
 of acting as the accounting unit, a function formerly fulfilled by the production 
 team 37 In Jiangxi, two-thirds of all private plots were collectivized and half the 
 communes subsumed brigades into one ownership level.38 

 The Lin Biao Affair in Zhejiang 

       The Lin Biao affair impacted seriously on elite politics in Zhejiang. Chen 
 Liyun, the second most senior cadre in the province, was a principal participant in 
 the plot to assassinate Mao. According to documents and accounts published after 
 the incident, Chen Liyun was one of the members of Lin Liguo’s (Lin Biao's son) 
 "joint fleet". This clandestine organization consisted of young and middle-aged 
 military officials who owed their advancement in the Cultural Revolution to Lin 
 Biao. Chen acted as the fleet's station head in Hangzhou and attended meetings of 
 the fleet there and in Shanghai. As an Air Force political officer, Chen came under 
 the leadership of Lin Biao's close collaborator and confidant, Wu Faxian. At Lin 
98        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

Biao's suggestion, Wu had promoted Lin Liguo to a substantial post within this 
arm of the PLA. Thus, Chen Liyun had organizational and personal ties with the 
Lin Biao group. At the Lushan plenum he had spoken out, at Wu Faxian s request, 
in favor of Chen Boda’s "theory of genius" and in support of the proposal to 

reestablish the post of state Chairman.39 
       The denouement of Lin Liguo’s plot occurred in August/September 1971. 
Mao headed south from Beijing to secure the support of key regional military 
 leaders, in the event of an open confrontation with his deputy and to explain the 
 nature and severity of the conflict which had been exacerbated since the Lushan 
 plenum. On 3 September the Chairman's train arrived in Hangzhou and Mao 
 immediately let Chen Liyun know that he was aware of his dealings with the Lin 

 Biao group. 
       Mao reportedly said to Chen in a tone of disgust: 

       What are your relations with Wu Faxian? At Lushan Wu Faxian 
        sought out several people: there was you, Chen Liyun, Shanghai's 
        Wang Weiguo [Political Commissar of the Fourth Air Force] and 
        someone from the Navy. What were you up to? 

 It is not surprising that Chen was speechless at this verbal onslaught and 
 equivocated in his answer. Another version of this confrontation, and one that 
 shows less certainty on Mao's part, reports that when Mao received Chen, Nan 
 Ping, Xiong Yingtang and Bai Zongshan after his arrival in Hangzhou he abruptly 
 quizzed Chen with the words: what have you been up to? Did Wu Faxian call you 
 to a meeting at Lushan? 
        On the evening of 8 September, Yu Xinye, Deputy-director of the Air Force 
 political department, arrived in Hangzhou in order to find out from Chen 
 information concerning Mao's itinerary and the content of the Chairman's talks 
 with the Zhejiang leadership. That same night, as an indication that he would not 
 be leaving in the immediate future, Mao instructed that his train be moved east 
 from Hangzhou to Shaoxing. A "responsible comrade" from the CC office in 
 Mao's entourage, looked everywhere to inform Chen Liyun of Mao's orders. 
 Chen, who was in charge of security in Hangzhou, was nowhere to be found 
 because he was in conference with Yu Xinye. This piece of evidence points to the 
  likelihood that Mao was no more than suspicious of Chen. Otherwise why would 
  he have allowed him to remain in charge of his security arrangements in 
  Hangzhou? Suddenly, on the afternoon of 10 September, Mao ordered the train 
  back to Hangzhou. He departed immediately for Shanghai, specifically requesting 
  that Chen Liyun not see him off as protocol required. 
        It is probable that while he was in Hangzhou Mao made determined efforts to 
  ensure that Nan Ping and Xiong Yingtang's 20th Army, which the "Outline of 
  'Project 571'" drafted by Lin Liguo and his associates marked down as an auxiliary 
                                                          MILITARY RULE IN ZHEJIANG 99 

force, remained loyal. In this endeavor he seems to have succeeded. Immediately 
after the crash of Lin's aircraft Chen Liyun was arrested for isolated examination. 
He had been captured after a helicopter in which he was passenger was intercepted 
and forced down by jet fighters. In the ensuing struggle he was seriously wounded. 
Chen was later described as a sworn follower (^E^) of the Lin Biao group. By 
contrast. Nan Ping and Xiong Yingtang remained in office until May 1972 and after 
 their removal (with Xiong being transferred and demoted to PLA units in the 
 Chengdu Military Region) were described, less severely, as Lin Biao's agents (ft 

 SA.) in Zhejiang. 

 Fallout from the Lin Biao Affair 

        Zhou Enlai, with the resigned acquiescence of a shattered Mao Zedong,40 
 moved decisively to purge the central military apparatus of Lin's followers. Lin's 
 closest and most senior supporters were dismissed and sent back to their home 
 provinces. On 3 October 1971 the CC MAC Executive Group was disbanded and 
 replaced by administrative conferences (<j> ), which were presided over 
 by Ye Jianying.41 On the same day, Li Desheng was appointed Director of the PLA 
 General Political Department42 The Chairman also moved to appease and mollify 
 military leaders who had opposed Lin in February 1967. In a reception in Chengdu 
 on 14 November 1971, Mao rehabilitated veteran marshalls and experienced 
 administrators of the State Council who had been held responsible for the 
 "February Countercurrent" and shifted blame for their persecution onto Lin Biao 

 and Chen Boda.43 
        Not surprisingly, the provincial media reflected the uncertainty of local 
 administrations as how to respond to these dramatic and potentially threatening 
 developments. An issue of China News Summary noted the scarcity of party 
 meetings, conferences, newspaper editorials and public appearances of provincial 
 leaders in the immediate aftermath of the affair. For Zhejiang the bi-monthly 
 journal recorded two meetings and eight editorials in the period from mid- 
 September 1971 until early April 1972.44 However, this report was somewhat 
  inaccurate. In January 1972 alone, Xiong Yingtang in particular maintained a high 
  profile with eight public appearances during the month, three of which were in 

  the company of Nan Ping.45 
        At the beginning of the campaign against Lin Biao, which went under the 
  vague title of "criticize revisionism and rectify work-style" (fttlf'S M,)/ 
  the Zhejiang provincial leadership took up the cause with some zeal, hoping 
  thereby to avoid political oblivion.46 In fact, the ZPC had issued a circular on 7 
  September 1971, before Lin's downfall, calling on the people to sing the 
  Internationale and the PLA slogans known as the "Three Rules and the Eight 
  Points for Attention"47 The words of the songs were published on page one of 
100 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

Zhejiang Daily on 14 September 1971, the day after Lin's defection. In December a 
meeting was held in Hangzhou to study the revolutionary songs.48 Mao had 
initiated this singing campaign during his August/September tour of the 
provinces, no doubt to remind local military officials who really was the founder 

and leader of the PLA.49 
      At the subdued National Day rally held on 30 September 1971 in Hangzhou, 
the speakers were ZPMD commander Xiong Yingtang and Chen Liyun's colleague 
of Unit 7350, Commander Bai Zongshan (&£?#). Bai’s appearance may have 
signified that while Chen Liyun had been involved in a serious conspiracy, his 
senior colleagues in Unit 7350 and the unit as a whole were not necessarily 
implicated. Bai's speech was certainly more self-critical than Xiong's contribution. 
He demanded of all PLA units stationed in the province that they implement the 
traditional codes of behavior and "combat arrogance and complacency", and 
conscientiously carry out the "three supports and two militaries" tasks. He went 
on to stress that "we must resolutely obey the centralized leadership of the local 
party committees".511 A report of December 1971 called on both the PLA and mass 
organization representatives serving on revolutionary committees to obey the 
unified leadership of the party.51 Nevertheless, the PLA-dominated leadership in 
Zhejiang was to face a major purge in 1972, to the extent that China News 
Summary in early 1973 could claim that of all provinces it had "suffered worst" 
from the anti-Lin Biao Campaign.52 

Party Reconstruction 

       The reconstruction of the CCP after the 9th Congress became a battleground 
for political control among the central and regional arms of the military, the 
Cultural Revolution radicals and the rehabilitated cadres, with alliances 
continually coalescing and shifting. In December 1969, when the Cultural 
Revolution Group under Chen Boda’s leadership was dissolved, the radicals lost 
an important organizational symbol of the Cultural Revolution and a body which 
had acted as the civilian radicals' national headquarters.55 A provisional body 
created to carry out the goals of a political campaign, its dissolution proclaimed the 
 termination, at least in an organizational sense, of the Cultural Revolution and 
 signalled the return to more orthodox political structures and administrative 
 arrangements. 
       In preparation for the reconstitution of local party committees after the 9th 
 Congress, revolutionary committees in Zhejiang began a political and ideological 
 movement at the end of 1969 to rectify leading groups 

       centered on the tasks of criticizing bourgeois and petit bourgeois ideas, 
       opposing bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, strengthening 
       democratic centralism and the sense of organization and discipline and 
                                                        MILITARY RULE IN ZHEJIANG 101 

       increasing the Party spirit of the proletariat.54 

The decision to launch the movement in Zhejiang was decided upon at the 5th 
enlarged plenum of the ZPRC in October 1969.55 It seems that a principal target of 
the criticism of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thinking was the Cultural 
Revolution activists whose failings were comprehensively detailed as follows: 

       Petty-bourgeois thinking manifested in politics is opportunism, 
       manifested in organization is sectarianism, manifested in ideology is 
       selfishness, manifested in ideological method is subjectivism, and 
       manifested in functions is pragmatism.56 

       Continued attacks on remnants of mass organizations and their refusal to 
 accept the termination of Cultural Revolution politics was stepped up in 1970-71.5'7 
 In late April 1970 a plenum of the ZPRC attacked leftist mass organizations and 
 bourgeois factionalism.58 It accused the rebels of using their influence on 
 revolutionary committees to resist directives from rebuilt party committees or 
 party core groups within revolutionary committees. Young and experienced cadres 
 alike were ordered to stay in touch with the masses and to put in regular stints of 
 manual labor. On 16 December 1969 the Zhejiang provincial May 7th cadre school 
 was opened59 There, through a regimen which combined work and study, officials 
 were supposed to rediscover the value of a simplistic lifestyle and to shake off 
 bureaucratic airs. Intellectuals were reminded to integrate themselves with the 
 labouring classes and to re-educate themselves. It was clear that the military would 
 not countenance continued organizational indiscipline or individualistic behavior 

 as it strove to rebuild the party in the province. 
        On 26 December 1969 the CCP CC released its decision to relocate tertiary 
 institutions in the countryside.60 In December 1970, Zhang Yongsheng s Zhejiang 
 Fine Arts College was relocated from Hangzhou to Nanbao (j^jM) brigade in 
 Tonglu county, south-west of the provincial capital. To improve its proletarian 
  credentials and to qualify as an acceptable institution for the enrollment of the 
  new student, the college was renamed the Zhejiang Worker-Peasant Fine Arts 
  Institute.61 Zhang Yongsheng spent time in the countryside at the college, 
  reportedly on the advice of Zhang Chunqiao who had suggested to him through 
  an intermediary that he temper himself by experiencing life as a worker, peasant 

  and soldier.62 
         Party rebuilding commenced under the domination and direction of the PLA. 
  According to Domes, the PLA used three organizational devices to control the 
  reformed party committees and to choose personnel amenable to it and the pattern 
  was evident in Zhejiang.65 The first device consisted of the "three supports and 
  two militaries" units stationed in various departments of the bureaucracy and in 
  units of production. In May 1970 the ZPMD convened a conference to sum up the 
102 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

experiences of the troops carrying out the assignment.64 It was disclosed that many 
personnel engaged in "three supports and two militaries" work had joined 
revolutionary committees or leading groups in the areas or units where they were 
stationed. "Three supports and two militaries" units also convened seminars and 
directed the staging of activists' congresses in the "Living Study and Application of 

Mao Zedong Thought", These congresses 
promoted Lin Biao's synthesized and truncated interpretation of Mao Zedong 
Thought65 and, according to one observer, acted as the functional equivalents of 

provincial party committees.66 
       The first activists' congress held in Zhejiang opened on November 1, 1969, 
and was attended by 4,700 delegates. Before the opening of the congress, the ZPRC 
had issued an appeal warning of the dangers of "counter-revolutionary 
economism" and "bourgeois factionalism" and demanding a correct attitude 
toward and acceptance of party leadership, as well as support for revolutionary 
committees and the PLA 67 The reiteration of these themes was a clear indication 
that the problems of indiscipline, anarchism and factionalism among former 
participants in the Cultural Revolution continued to worry the authorities. Apart 
from former Governor Zhou Jianren, who was now Vice-chairman of the ZPRC, 
all the principal speakers at the congress were senior military cadres.68 In his 
speech at the closing session on 10 November, Nan Ping issued the call to 
revolutionize leading groups. Nanbao brigade, where Zhang Yongsheng would 
later discover the joys of rural life, was conferred the title of advanced unit and 
activist in the movement.69 The letter of proposal issued to the conference on the 
final day contained fulsome praise of Lin Biao and acknowledged the PLA's 
achievements in the province. The letter also called for the continuation of study 
classes and the campaign of mass criticism against Liu Shaoqi and Jiang Hua.70 
       The second organizational device was the addition of military representatives 
to civilian institutions where they were working in large numbers. The third 
device was the dominance by military representatives of party core groups 
established within revolutionary committees. The core groups supervised party 
rebuilding and undertook preparations for the convocation of party congresses at 
various administrative levels.71 As the great majority of PLA members of 
revolutionary committees were also CCP members, the proportion of soldiers in 
 core groups was high. Additionally, party groups in the military had not 
experienced the same level of disruption to their activities as their civilian 
 counterparts, although party organs in the ZPMD had been restructured in 1969. 
 Party offices study offices ), work offices (T/fy) and examination 
offices had been established in an administrative reshuffle modeled on 
 that of the MAC and it was carried out under the leadership of Nan Ping and Chen 
Liyun.77

       Party membership among representatives of mass organizations was much 
lower and more recent. For example, although he was Vice-chairman of the ZPRC, 
Zhang Yongsheng was not a member of the provincial CCP core group. At the 
time of the 9th CCP Congress, Zhang was not even a member of the CCP. At the 
Congress Zhang Chunqiao criticized the military-dominated leadership of 
Zhejiang for its unwillingness to admit rebels into the party. Nan Ping ordered 
Shen Ce, who was responsible for party organizational work in the province, to 
contact Hangzhou and arrange for Zhang's admission before the Congress 
finished. In 1978 Shen recalled that Zhang Chunqiao had praised Zhang 
Yongsheng as a national student rebel leader who had qualified for party 

 membership.73 
       Overall, the progress of party reconstruction followed a tortuous route.74 
 Initially, according to Domes, it was proposed to begin at the grassroots and work 
 upward. But this strategy, initiated in May 1969, was abandoned later in that year 
 in favour of focus on the county level, a decision probably taken at the central 
 work meeting on party rectification and party building held in Beijing in 
 November 1969.75 The first county committee was reestablished in November 
 1969 in Hunan province but by October of the following year only forty-five 
 committees in a total of 2,185 counties had been set up.78 
        Then, at the fractious Lushan plenum of August/September 1970, the 
 decision was made to switch the focus of party reconstruction to the provincial 
 level. In November 1970 Hunan became the first province to hold a party congress 
 since the commencement of the Cultural Revolution 77 One observer has claimed 
 that the procrastination and shifts in emphasis accompanying party rebuilding 
 contributed to the discrediting of Chen Boda.78 However, it is unlikely that Chen 
 Boda was in charge of party reconstruction. Alternate Politburo member Ji 
 Dengkui presided and Kang Sheng and Chen Boda delivered speeches at the 
  conference on party building which was held by the party center in April 1970. But 
  the three-man group established to oversee party rectification did not include 
  Chen. Its membership consisted of Kang, Zhang Chunqiao and Xie Fuzhi.79 
        The main reason for the leadership's indecisiveness and change of mind 
  stemmed from the continued resistance and disruption to the new order by 
  disgruntled mass-organization members of revolutionary committees, urged on by 
  their illicit organizations. In January 1970 the party journal Red Flag carried an 
  article by a model in party building, PLA unit 8341, criticizing the "theory of many 
  centers".80 The central authorities also propagated the experiences of Beijing's "six 
  factories and two colleges" in party building.81 In January and February 1970 the 
  CCP CC successively issued directives and a circular concerning counter¬ 
  revolutionary sabotage, graft and embezzlement, speculation and extravagance 
  and waste which initiated a ferocious campaign known as the "one hit and three 
104 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

antis" (— ft HjR>82 In August 1970 People's Daily published an article 
criticizing mass organizations for usurping the role of the party and rejecting its 
leadership.83 The problem of convincing the rebels of the late 1960s to adjust to the 
post-Cultural Revolution dispensation remained as insoluble as ever. 

The Fifth CCP Zhejiang Provincial Congress, January 1971 

       Before the Lin Biao affair had come to a climax in 1971, provincial party 
congresses were held across China. A central meeting to prepare for these 
congresses was held on 13 October 1970 and addressed by Kang Sheng.83 The salient 
characteristics of the Party committees elected at the congresses were the 
consolidation of military power in the localities, the return to office of purged 
civilian officials and the continuing decline in the influence of mass organization 
representatives.85 In Zhejiang this trend was perhaps even more strongly evident 
than elsewhere in the country. Essentially, the party leadership elected at the 
congress was a continuation of the ZPRC leadership installed in 1968. But its 
military representation was far stronger and the decline in representation from the 
other two groups in the "three-way alliance" continued. 
       The 5th Zhejiang Provincial Congress of the CCP met from 20 to 28 January 
1971 86 At the time it was described as the 4th congress but a contemporary 
observer noted this as being incorrect.87 One thousand one hundred and fifty-nine 
delegates, of whom 43 spoke, attended the nine-day session. During a break in 
proceedings delegates made a tour of Jiaxing's South Lake (j^j$jj) in northern 
Zhejiang, site of the concluding session of the CCP's 1st Congress of 1921. Before 
the closure of the congress, the delegates elected a provincial party committee 
consisting of 67 members and 22 alternate members. This committee in turn 
elected a standing committee of thirteen members, six of whom were of secretary 
status. 
       The congress formalized the dominance of the military over the civilian 
 wing of the party. Of the six secretaries and deputy-secretaries appointed to the CCP 
 ZPC, two represented the 20th Army (1st Secretary Nan Ping and Secretary Xiong 
 Yingtang), one the 5th Air Force (Secretary Chen Liyun) and two the Navy 
 (deputy-secretaries Xie Zhenghao and Chai Qikun - The remaining 
 deputy-secretary was Lai Keke, the sole survivor of the pre-Cultural Revolution 
 secretariat. According to one source, four of the five military representatives. Nan 
 Ping, Xiong Yingtang, Xie Zhenghao and Chai Qikun had all risen to prominence 
 since Lin Biao’s assumption of the post of Minister for Defence in 1959.88 If true, 
 the connection may have only been coincidental, given Lin's 4th Field Army 
 background and the influence of the 3rd Field Army in East China. 
       Of the remaining seven members of the standing committee, at least two 
 were from the military, two were veteran cadres and only two represented mass

organizations. Hua Yinfeng and Jiang Baodi were both from United Headquarters 
but, as previously mentioned, they were not noted for their rebelliousness. United 
Headquarters did not succeed in gaining a place for its leader Zhang Yongsheng on 
the standing committee. Since the dissolution of United Headquarters in August 
1969, Zhang had been laboring in the countryside. He had been sent there or, as he 
delicately phrased it, permitted to go there by the ZPRC provincial party core 
group.89 Zhang was most probably elected a member of the CCP ZPC. Another 
leading rebel, Weng Senhe, was elected an alternate member of the ZPC at the 
congress. Weng's length of party membership was even shorter than Zhang 
Yongsheng's. He had joined the CCP in September 1970, just months before the 

opening of the congress.90

        In 1968 the provincial leadership installed in Zhejiang had been characterized 
 by its overwhelming military and outside nature. The CCP ZPC leadership of 
 January 1971 was even more so. By David Goodman's definition of provincial 
 outsider, that is a cadre who had either served in another province or had held no 
 prior leadership post in the Chinese state,91 Zhejiang in 1971 was ruled 
106       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

overwhelmingly by outsiders, at least at the very top of its administration. Only 
two members of the thirteen-strong standing committee of the CCP ZPC beside Lai 
Keke, had previous administrative experience in Zhejiang's civilian 

bureaucracy.92 
       Other contemporary observers computed the dominance of outside cadres 
over the leadership of the Zhejiang administration.93 In his comprehensive, 
comparative analysis of provincial party committees elected in 1970 to 1971 Teiwes 
has correlated the stability and localism indexes, which he had utilized for a 
comparative study of provincial committee during the period 1956-66,94 to the re¬ 
establishment of party committees. He found that due to the lack of any significant 
statistical relationship between pre-Cultural Revolution indices and patterns 
established in 1967, factors and tensions unique to the extraordinary political 
struggle of the mid-1960s determined the pattern of behavior manifested by 
provincial politicians. However, over the period 1967-73 covered by the study, 
Teiwes found that the pre-Cultural Revolution pattern of provincial appointment 
 gradually reasserted itself as representatives of mass organizations and the political 
 outsiders, who had made such a dramatic entry into the political system in 1967, 

 were squeezed out.93 
       Zhejiang conformed to many of the trends observed by Teiwes, but in certain 
 respects it deviated from them. For example, there was no "substantial injection of 
 administrative experience"96 into the provincial leadership in the years 1969-70. 
 The influx of veteran administrators did not occur until 1972. The "drastic decline 
 in the role of political outsiders",97 (low-ranking cadres and mass representatives) 
 observed by Teiwes in the re-establishment of party committees was not obvious 
 in Zhejiang because these groups had never obtained substantial power. Their 
 strength lay in the ability to hinder, obstruct, sabotage, create tensions and splits 
 and to withhold support or recognition. 
        In Teiwes' stability index (a measure of the continuity of provincial 
 leaderships as defined by the members of party secretariats),98 Zhejiang had 
 dropped from 17th (in the basically stable category) for the period 1956-66 to be 
 ranked 23rd (limited continuity) for the years 1967-73. Likewise on the localism 
 index (a measure of the extent to which outsiders were brought into a provincial 
 administration), it fell in rank from 13th (1967-68) to 21st (1969-70) to 26th (1971) of 
 29 provincial-level units.99 As Teiwes observed, the provincial elites of the early 
 1970s retained only one important shared experience, that of common service in 
 institutions of the new order, and this experience was marked by intense conflict 
 rather than smooth working relationships.100 However, the decentralization of 
 power in the Cultural Revolution did not signify an increase in centrifugal 
  tendencies because the center's monopoly over the power of patronage ensured 
  the selection of provincial leaders subordinate to its will.101 Zhejiang exemplified 
                                          MILITARY RULE IN ZHEJIANG 107 

the truth of this statement. Never, since the formalization of provincial 
administrative structures in 1954-55, had the Zhejiang leadership been more 
compliant to central direction and less able or willing to represent local interests.

          with Lin Biao and his family by taking charge of the construction of a luxury compound of 
          villas and offices on Three Terrace Mountain, on the outskirts of Hangzhou. It had five 
          villas, underground defence facilities, an indoor swimming-pool, shops and expansive and 
          attractive grounds covering over 20 hectares. The article alleges, and the accusation 
          circulates widely in Hangzhou, that all the workers on the site were later executed in secret. 
          The compound is now known as the Zhejiang Guesthouse. For a recent article on the project, 
          whose original name was the "April 1970 engineering project" (-b 0.0111) see Cheng 
          Ying, fr ft" (Lin Biao’s villa exposed), $ fij 
           (The Nineties Monthly), No. 1,1990, pp. 76-80. The complex cost more than 20 million yuan, 
          reportedly a greater sum than the total state outlay on housing in Hangzhou for the twenty 
          years 1949 to 1969. See RMRB, September 16,1978, p.l. 
    40. Mao's health reportedly suffered greatly from the shock induced by Lin’s defection. After 
          U.S. President Richard Nixon met Mao on February 21,1972, he recorded his impressions of 
          Mao s feebleness, sallow complexion and difficulty in speaking, which he attributed to the 
          possible after-effects of apoplexy, as well as the Chairman’s expressionless face and 
          detached eyes. See Gao Gao and Yan Jiaqi, "Wenhua dageming", p. 469. The Chairman 
          remained in bed for weeks on end. See Frederick C. Teiwes, "Mao and His Lieutenants",

          which forbade any criticism of Mao and Lin Biao, that the Shenyang party member Zhang

          same phenomenon recurred in the neighboring provinces of Jiangsu and Jiangxi. In fact there 
          has been some confusion over the actual number of provincial party congresses held in 
          Zhejiang. Between 1949 and 1955 the CCP held a series (5 at least) of party conferences 
                 ^ z/lSO in the province and in July 1956 convened the second provincial party 
          congress (ft ftSA £), thereby bestowing retrospective recognition to the congress 
          held at Pingyang county, Wenzhou in July 1939. Further congresses followed - from December 
          1959 to January 1960 (3rd), April 1963 (4th) - before the 5th congress of January 1971. By 
          renumbering the 5th congress as the 4th the provincial leaders were withdrawing official 
          recognition from the 1939 congress. During the Cultural Revolution, most probably during the 
          "purification of class ranks campaign", pre-1949 leaders of the ZPC such as Liu Ying 
          (XlJ£), who had been elected secretary of the CCP ZPC at its 1939 congress, and cadres 
          working in southern Zhejiang during the 1930s were branded the "southern Zhejiang 
          renegade clique . See Z/RB, December 9,1978, p. 1. Details of congress dates come from
