                THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY, 1974-75 


The Struggle at the Center, October 1974-January 1975 

      By the latter half of 1974 the anti-Lin anti-Confucius campaign had largely 
been brought under control. In an informal talk to overseas Chinese on the 25th 
anniversary of the People's Republic Deng Xiaoping, who had assumed much of 
the administrative responsibilities from the ailing Zhou Enlai, played down the 
significance of the campaign.1 Later in the month as preparations got underway to 
convene the long-awaited 4th NPC, the factional maneuvering between the 
Cultural Revolution radicals and the Zhou/Deng led group of veteran 
administrators reached a climax, with both sides striving to gain Mao’s support. 
The issue which sparked off the crisis in October 1974 related to the purchase of 
ships from overseas to carry China's international trade. On 18 June Wang 
Hongwen had accused the advocates of the proposal as being "false foreign devils" 
              who "worshipped the foreign bourgeoisie" and described the 
policy as pursuing the "revisionist line".2 
      This issue smouldered until October 1974 when, at a Politburo meeting on 
the 17th of that month, Jiang Qing insisted that Deng Xiaoping declare his position 
on the issue.3 Deng reportedly answered that he would investigate the matter. The 
Cultural Revolution radicals were eager to place the wily veteran in an awkward 
position and compromise him on an issue that they thought might arouse Mao's 
sensibilities. Their timing was critical. On 4 October Mao had proposed in a 
telephone conversation with Wang Hongwen that Deng become first Vice¬ 
premier of the State Council at the forthcoming NPC, a step that would ensure his 
succession as Premier. A CCP CC notice of 11 October quoted Mao to the effect that 
 the Cultural Revolution had already been going for eight years and that it was 
 time for unity and stability within the party and army. Meanwhile, articles 
 appeared in the press praising the Empress Lu and legalist politicians, a not very 
 subtle allusion to Jiang Qing's aspirations for future leadership. 
      The tensions and factional rivalries which climaxed in late 1974 and early 
 1975 were exacerbated by an important factor — Mao's prolonged absence from 
Beijing. On 13 October the Chairman arrived in Changsha and remained there 
until early February, before stopping in Nanchang and Hangzhou on his way back 
to the capital. Despite his poor health Mao continued to play the role of final 
arbiter in all major decisions, and none of his senior subordinates dared challenge 
this practice, even in his absence. Therefore, Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian, Wang 
Hongwen and even the hospitalized Zhou Enlai were forced to make the journey 
to the south to report to Mao, solicit his views and instructions and report them 
back to the Politburo. Deng and Li escorted foreign leaders to Changsha to receive 
an audience with the Chairman, who continued to take a keen interest in foreign 
affairs. 
      In the wake of the uproar at the Politburo session on 17 October, which 
 resulted in the meeting's inconclusive adjournment, the Shanghai radicals went 
 into emergency session to decide on their next step. The following day Wang 
 Hongwen was despatched to Changsha where, in a meeting with Mao, he accused 
 Zhou Enlai and other leaders including Deng Xiaoping, of creating a political 
 atmosphere similar to that which had prevailed at the 1970 Lushan plenum. Mao 
 rebuffed Wang. The Chairman's two foreign affairs interpreters cum advisers and 
 intermediaries (H *§ pj X his niece Wang Hairong and Tang Wensheng 
 (Nancy Tang), then became involved in a political tug of war between Zhou Enlai 
 and Jiang Qing, in which both leaders asked them to act as their advocates with 
 Mao. 
       Mao accepted Zhou Enlai's version of events by confirming his position as 
 Premier and instructed him, together with Wang Hongwen, to take charge of all 
 arrangements for the 4th NPC, including the selection of personnel. Mao uttered 
 critical remarks about Jiang Qing, both in talks with Wang Hongwen and his two 
 liaison personnel, as well as in letters to his wife written in November 1974. 
 Factional hostility and personal animosities had reached such a state that between 
 21 October and early November, Zhou Enlai was forced to divide the Politburo 
 into three groups and hold separate meetings with them in hospital. On 6 
 November he reported the result of these deliberations in a letter to Mao. 
       In the final composition of the State Council ministry which would be 
 ratified at the NPC, Zhou and his supporters gave ground on the appointments of 
 the Ministers of Culture and Sports in order to ensure the selection of their 
 candidate, Zhou Rongxin as Minister of Education, ahead of the radicals' favored 
 choice Chi Qun. Between 23 and 27 December 1974 Zhou and Wang Hongwen 
 held final talks with Mao in Changsha. Mao praised Deng as being a rare talent 
 who was both politically and ideologically strong (" 'fa S 
  3E3§")/ and criticized Jiang Qing for her ambition and factional activities. The 
 intrigues and back-stage machinations reached their culmination in January 1975. 
  At the 2nd plenum of the 10th CCP CC Deng was appointed party Vice-chairman 
                                 THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 179 

and member of the Politburo standing committee and confirmed in the posts of 
CC MAC Vice-chairman and PLA Chief of Staff. In the political balancing-act, 
Zhang Chunqiao was appointed Director of the PLA General Political Department. 
The 4th NPC, held between 13 and 18 January installed Deng as senior Vice¬ 
premier, with Zhang Chunqiao's name appearing immediately next in the 
ranking of vice-premiers. The factional power balance may have tilted against the 
radicals, but not to an irretrievable extent. 
      In his report to the people's congress, Zhou Enlai announced the ambitious 
but vague plan for the accomplishment of the four modernizations (of 
agriculture, industry, defence and science and technology) by the end of the 
century. He also let it be known within party circles that his senior deputy, Deng 
Xiaoping, would be in charge of the work of the State Council.4 It was Deng who 
shortly afterward set about putting flesh on the bare bones of Zhou's four 
modernizations by convening a series of conferences in the fields of industry, 
military affairs, planning, science and technology and agriculture. He set up and 
supervised a think-tank, comprising theoreticians and professional experts, to 
prepare three major documents which set out his political and economic policy 
positions. 
      Meanwhile, by his absence from the capital while the important deliberations 
of January were taking place, Mao had signalled that he did not fully endorse the 
proceedings, although he repeated his directive concerning stability and unity 
before the close of the CC plenum.5 In yet another lurch to the left, Mao launched 
another campaign, this time in the realm of theory, while the provinces were still 
discussing the documents of the 4th NPC. The study campaign began with the 9 
February 1975 editorial of the People’s Daily discussing the significance and 
content of the post-revolutionary period known as the dictatorship of the 
proletariat and China's similarities to, and differences from, a capitalist economic 
system. The editorial quoted excerpts of statements made by Mao the previous 
year. One extract derived from remarks made by the Chairman on 20 October 1974 
in his reception of the Danish Prime Minister Hartling. The remaining sentences 
 dated from the meeting which Mao had held with Zhou Enlai and Wang 
Hongwen on 26 December 1974.6 
      The Chairman’s remarks on the nature of socialism and the state of China's 
 socio-political system were circulated and propagated alongside his comments on 
 the need for "stability and unity" and the importance of developing the economy. 
The uncertainties of the distant communist utopia were thus counterposed to the 
 more immediate and tangible prospects of political harmony and an 
 improvement in living standards. Throughout 1975, alongside articles exploring 
 ways to restrict bourgeois rights ($ j* RfrSRfett) and Press on with the 
 Maoist "continuous revolution", the Chinese media carried reports extolling 
180 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

production increases and industrial discipline and promoting economic policies 
designed to foster efficiency and profit. The propaganda publicizing the ideals of 
the four modernizations was of necessity dressed up in a Maoist garb, but 
nevertheless it was clear that two sets of voices were speaking in Beijing. The 
debate placed added pressure on provincial politicians who had to decide which 
line to emphasize in local propaganda. The contradictions between Maoist 
rhetoric and policy direction were blatant and difficult to accommodate. 

The Campaign to Study the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, 1975 

      To understand the purpose of the campaign to study the dictatorship of the 
proletariat and its focus on "bourgeois rights" in particular, it is necessary to 
examine briefly Karl Marx's principal writing on the subject.7 In the Critique of 
the Gotha Programme, written in 1875, Marx had defined bourgeois rights as the 
form of distribution under the "first phase" of communist society. Exploitation no 
longer existed in such a society, yet equal right to the means of consumption was 
premised on unequal attributes and different family circumstances, resulting in de 
facto inequality.8 In directives released in February 1975, Mao commented that the 
eight-grade wage scale practised in Chinese industry was an example of bourgeois 
rights which should be restricted. But he remained typically silent on the policy 
consequences of his statement, merely noting that "we should do more reading of 
Marxist-Leninist works".9 The two major articles published in the campaign by 
Yao Wenyuan and Zhang Chunqiao, while issuing warnings against the use of 
material incentives, offered no specific suggestions for radical policy changes.10 
      Deng Xiaoping very quickly made it clear that the discussion on bourgeois 
rights was completely irrelevant to the realities of China's backward economy. He 
reportedly stated in March 1975 that, "To restrict bourgeois rights, we also must 
have a material foundation, for without it, how can we do so?"11 In June 1975 
 whilst in Shanghai, Deng commented on proposals to reduce income differentials 
by remarking; "Why do we describe everything as bourgeois right? Isn't it right to 
receive more for more work done? Should this be called bourgeois right?"12 His 
basic stand was summed up in two short sentences. "Revolution is liberating the 
 productive forces. Revolution is promoting the development of productive 
 forces".13 
      The debate soon degenerated into a slanging match over which ideological 
 deviation was more dangerous -- empiricism or dogmatism. Empiricism was the 
 radicals' label for veteran cadres who emphasized practical experience at the 
 expense of theory. On 1 March 1975, the same day as the publication of Yao 
 Wenyuan's article, Zhang Chunqiao delivered a speech to a meeting of PLA 
 political department directors in which he stressed the dangers of empiricism.14 
 Jiang Qing expressed her agreement with Zhang and Yao's position in speeches of 
                                  THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 181 


3, 4 and 5 April 1975.15 Dogmatism, on the other hand, was the veterans' 
description for theory separated from practical reality. On 23 April 1975, in 
comments he appended to a Xinhua despatch submitted by Yao Wenyuan, Mao 
concluded with the following biting remarks: 

      There are not many in our Party who really understand Marxism- 
      Leninism. Some think they do understand, while in actuality they do 
      not fully understand even though they think they are right and are 
      always lecturing others. That is also a manifestation of ignorance of 
      Marxism-Leninism.16 

      The effect of the campaign on policy direction, wages' policy in particular, is 
unclear. It was asserted at the time by the Taiwan Central News Agency that in 
February 1975, during a talk in Shanghai, Jiang Qing had demanded that 
individuals earning high incomes take a "voluntary" cut.17 However, it seems 
that more detailed discussions went no further than supporting the existing 
system while calling for a gradual reduction in individual income differentials.18 
In the second half of 1974 some local authorities had reportedly granted wage rises 
and reinstituted bonuses.19 The campaign of 1975 may therefore best be seen in the 
context of a reaction to policy initiatives considered politically unsound, rather 
than as a radical thrust in itself. The national press carried a series of articles 
railing against material incentives and bonuses, and bonuses were reportedly 
abolished in the railway system. Reported attempts were made in February and 
March 1975 to introduce voluntary Saturday labor on a national basis and unpaid 
weekday labor in Henan province. But the experiments were short-lived and 
unsuccessful.20 
      One observer has correctly described the campaign as "so ambitious in theory 
yet so modest in intent". "The radicals", he observed, 

      succeeded in blocking a scheduled wage adjustment and called on 
      workers voluntarily to forego extra pay and donate their labor, but they 
      did not call for an immediate elimination of commodity trade and the 
      monetary exchange system, for levelling distribution patterns, or for a 
      shift from the "works" to "needs" principle. 

The radicals thus "found themselves in the awkward position of nullifying the 
legitimacy and ideological rationale of 'bourgeois right' while ignoring its societal 
manifestations."21 Another analyst also commented on what he termed the 
"defensive nature of the campaign" and asserted that it aimed "to deter the 
growth of new inequalities rather than to impose Spartan egalitarianism on 
Chinese society".22 
      Certain Taiwan sources, however, drew the unjustifiable conclusion from 
mainland propaganda that a wholesale adjustment to the industrial wage 
structure was carried out, leading to widespread discontent among workers. It was 
182 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

claimed that in April 1975 the central authorities issued a document simplifying 
the wage structure for workers from eight to three grades, allowing for large 
differences between each grade. Another source asserted that factories and mines 
in various places changed the eight-grade scale to five, three or two grades, 
"seriously lowering the already poor standard of living".23 Observers inside China 
reported quite a different story. The Times' correspondent in Beijing visited a coal 
 mine and was informed that while changes to the wage system were being 
 discussed, no decision had been reached. A Canadian student in Beijing was told 
 that changes to the wage system were confined to raising the lowest grade and 
 lowering the highest. However, strong opposition from workers had prevented 
 any reduction in the highest graded Given the extreme conservatism of wage 
 policy in the Maoist era, these accounts ring true. This is not to deny that workers 
 had real grievances over their pay and working conditions. The rhetoric of the 
 campaign undoubtedly served to attract lower-paid workers to the radical camp as 
 well as raise expectations on the wages' front.25 

 Factionalism at the Center, February-June 1975 

      After the 10th CCP 2nd plenum, at Mao's request Deng had assumed control 
 of the day-to-day affairs of the Central Committee. He took over responsibility 
 from Wang Hongwen, who had reportedly disappointed the Chairman.26 But 
 Mao's confidence in his independent-minded deputy was to be sorely tested in the 
 following months. Dissension within the highest decision-making circles was rife, 
 forcing Mao to intercede. At a meeting of the Politburo on 3 May 1975, Mao 
 repeated an earlier warning of July 1974 about the "Gang of Four", while 
 simultaneously making unspecified criticisms of Deng's abrasiveness and 
 impulsiveness.27 Yet Mao added that the problem was not great and that it should 
 not be blown out of proportion This session of the 
 Politburo followed one on 27 April at which Jiang Qing had come under fire for 
 her speeches earlier in the month. Then, on 27 May and 3 June, the Politburo 
  under the chairmanship of Deng launched attacks on the four radicals. Of the 
  four, Wang Hongwen alone admitted to mistakes. However, in a letter to her 
  husband on 28 June, Jiang Qing stated that the criticisms of her Politburo 
  colleagues had really shaken her up (|tji zjjj ^) and confessed that the 
  existence of a "Gang of Four" had the potential to split the party center.29 
       Despite Mao's reservations about his leadership style, Deng's crusade to 
  "rectify" all aspects of the affairs of the CCP, especially those related to economic 
  policy, continued unabated. Mao had called for rectification but had not specified 
  how it should be carried out.30 Given past experience, however, the Chairman's 
  reticence should have made Deng extremely circumspect. Nevertheless, he 
  pressed on. In a speech at the forum on the iron and steel industry held at the end 
                                  THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 183 

of May 1975 Deng rallied his supporters to stand fast against factionalism.31 
Repeating earlier demands that discipline be enforced in the workplace, Deng 
advised factory officials to withhold pay from absentee workers and to order out of 
the factory gates those who refused to work. On 4 June 1975 the central authorities 
issued Document no. 13 of 1975 calling for fulfillment of the year's plan in the 
iron and steel industry.32 The shortage of coal was the principal factor contributing 
to the problems in the industry,33 but by the end of June the situation in iron and 
steel production had improved somewhat.34 Between 16 June and 11 August the 
State Council convened a conference to discuss the basic principles guiding the 
planned economy. The meeting decided to reassert central control over state 
enterprises, many of which had been handed over to local authorities in the 
major decentralization decision of 1970.35 It also stipulated that the maximum 
number of non-productive personnel permitted in state enterprises was limited to 
 18% in large and medium-sized units and 10% in smaller plants.36 Deng's drive 
 and indefatigability appeared to be having an effect. 

 Solving the "Zhejiang Problem" 

      With the conclusion of the campaign against Lin Biao and Confucius the 
factionalism which the campaign had generated and intensified at local levels 
 demanded urgent attention. Provincial administrations such as Zhejiang had 
failed to cope with the challenge posed by former Cultural Revolution rebels, as 
 the previous chapter of this study has demonstrated at some length. The slump in 
industrial production was evidence of the damage factionalism had wrought. 
Unity at the center was the most important precondition for curbing the worst 
manifestations of factionalism. As previous sections of this chapter have shown, 
 the center was anything but united at this crucial time. Nevertheless, there seems 
to have been a tacit agreement that a truce should be declared in the factional war 
and negotiations begun to find a solution to problems in the localities. 
      To this end, in December 1974 the CC ordered the major participants in the 
factional struggles in Zhejiang to join a study class and attend a conference in 
Beijing.37 Negotiations proved long and difficult and it appears that they lasted for 
over one month, until late December or early January 1975. High on the agenda 
were such controversial topics as the "two crashthroughs", the role of urban 
militia commands and the activities of factional groups. Wang Hongwen played a 
central role in the deliberations. He addressed the participants at least twice, on 
 December 17 and 19, and was not slow to express his preferences for different 
factional leaders and organizations.38 But even Wang distanced himself 
somewhat from his over-zealous proteges and could not protect Weng Senhe and 
He Xianchun from criticism. The political pendulum had swung against the 
central radicals and Wang informed Weng that although he shared his views. 
184 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

"I'm not the Political Bureau".39 He Xianchun was concerned that the meeting 
would proscribe the "two crashthroughs".40 Wang tried to cheer up the 
disconsolate He with the words, "You must try and win credit" (#- *t).41 
      Before the opening of the conference, the CCP ZPC had submitted a 
document to the CC entitled "A report requesting instructions on how to handle 
correctly the crash induction of party members and the crash promotion of cadres" 
        lEft W £ M fa ^ £ & ft 
                         In response, the CC issued a document approving 
 the suggestions contained in the Zhejiang report42 The center decided to disband 
 the campaign small groups and Zhang, Weng and He were worried about the fate 
 of the groups' members. In a letter to Wang Hongwen of December 14 they 
 brought to his attention the possibility that 

      members at the grassroots could be accused of arbitrarily leaving their 
      work posts and have their wages deducted. Moreover, they could be 
      further accused of sabotaging the unified leadership of the party and of 
      riding roughshod over party committees. At some places and in some 
      units new and veteran cadres could therefore be hauled out and 
      struggled against. Decisions already made to promote cadres and admit 
      party members could be invalidated, and the persons concerned 
      investigated and stood aside. Those units could thus return to the state 
      of paralysis they were in at the beginning of the campaign.43 

 Rather than forbidding the "two crashthroughs" outright, the central authorities 
 requested "deferral" of party recruitment and cadre promotion. Weng and He 
 promptly ignored the suggestion by continuing to stack committees and important 
 posts with their nominees. Weng Senhe stated defiantly: "as long as the 'two 
 crashthroughs' are secure I'm willing to go to jail". (Kir" 5$5*5" 

      The CC also issued directives to bring factional confrontation to an end and 
 to curb the power of the urban militia. However, the directives were ambiguous 
 and far from decisive. Zhang, Weng and He, in their letter of December 14 to 
 Wang Hongwen, attempted to prove that the continued existence of the urban 
 militia was essential to the maintenance of public order in Hangzhou.45 While 
 the conference was still in session. He Xianchun was forced by the death of his 
 mother to return to the provincial capital to make arrangements for her funeral. 
 Whilst in Hangzhou He reportedly consulted senior members of the municipal 
 party committee on how to improve the reputation of the militia command and 
 to justify its continued existence. The militia was therefore mobilized to handle 
 incidents which were manufactured to illustrate its indispensability to the 
 maintenance of law and order in the city. All told, ten such incidents took place at 
 this time. 
       The most serious incident involved the case of fighting and arson at the 
                                  THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 185 

Hangzhou Cable Factory on 3 December 1974 46 Instead of helping fight the fire, 
the urban militia contingents under Xia Genfa’s command piled more furniture 
on the blaze and prevented all efforts to extinguish it. Factional supporters of the 
militia in the telecommunications bureau jammed telephone lines into the 
factory. A report was then submitted to Beijing stating that the militia had 
performed meritorious service in stopping the fighting and putting out the fire. In 
order to get to the bottom of the event the CC summoned the leaders of the CCP 
HMC, Wang Zida and Wang Xing, to the capital to hear their explanations. 
However, considering their affiliation with the "mountain top" faction, the two 
Wangs were unlikely to provide an objective account of the incident. 
      Further violent incidents shook Hangzhou as the discussions continued in 
Beijing. The Hangzhou Silk Brocade Mill (^ft jt| J“), manufacturer of 
the silk portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong which once adorned the homes of 
people all over China, was the scene of three major fights in December 1974.47 In 
one incident twenty-two people were wounded, seven so seriously that two and a 
half years later they could not work 48 Large-scale fighting also erupted at Weng's 
silk mill on December 25, 1974, and the pro-Weng forces were forced out of the 
factory. In retaliation, Weng ordered his supporters to attack the provincial guest¬ 
house and three people were injured and property destroyed.49 
      A bloody skirmish also took place at the Hangzhou East Wind Silk Mill.50 
The Hangzhou Silk Bureau, under Weng Senhe's direction, was responsible for 
twenty silk mills. Weng's supporters at the East Wind mill were active in trying to 
change the factory's leadership and Weng's subordinates at the silk bureau 
recommended to him that the party secretary of the East Wind be encouraged to 
retire so that a younger man could take his place. However, Weng’s appointee as 
replacement aroused such differences of opinion among the work-force that the 
militia was mobilized to deal with it. 
      One night in November 1974, the militia arrived at the mill to recruit 
workers for the construction of defence lines for a forthcoming battle at the nearby 
silk brocade mill. A truckload of men was assigned to seize two opponents of the 
 "mountain top" faction from their homes located in the grounds of the brocade 
mill. Workers of the East Wind mill came out in sufficiently large numbers to 
support their comrades that they fought the militia off. When the setback was 
reported to the acting head of the silk bureau, a close associate of Weng's, he 
became enraged and reportedly instructed: "the stronghold of the restorationist 
forces is the East Wind Mill. They must be annihilated". On the evening of 13 
November 1974, six truckloads of militiamen converged on the East Wind mill 
but again they were beaten off. Weng Senhe, upon hearing news of this second 
humiliation, reportedly said: "this group at the East Wind mill are dumb; your 
bats and clubs haven't drawn blood" 0£^7); the old cadres fought their way 
186 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

up in a hail of bullets, so we must fight our way up with cane hats and iron clubs 

      tf th 5ft )• Weng dismissed his subordinates with the words that if 
 they did not crush the opposition, then they need not bother to come back to him 
 for further advice. 
      Wu Rongtao, the victim and writer of the article describing these events, 
 then related what occurred on the evening of 3 January 1975. Wu was at home 
 when late that night over twenty men appeared at his door brandishing iron 
 clubs. They trussed him up and threw him blindfolded and gagged onto the floor 
 of a vehicle, before speeding out of the dty proper. Out on a deserted highway in 
 Banshan district, they hauled Wu out of the car, covered his head with his padded 
 jacket and commenced to beat, stab and kick him. Wu’s assailants left him 
 unconscious at a T-intersection in the expectation that he would be run over and 
 killed. However, Wu managed to come around and crawled to a nearby factory. 
 There he contacted his unit which sent out three cars to rush him to hospital 
 where he was treated for wounds to the head, rump and leg. The next day, when 
 his opponents at the mill found that he had not died from the beating, they 
 claimed that Wu had gone to Banshan to "make link-ups" and had been detained 
 and wounded by people who objected to his interference in their internal affairs. 
       Several factors stand out in Wu's clearly subjective account. First, the 
 savagery of the measures used to deal with factional opponents testified to the 
 depth of hatred among sections of the working class in Hangzhou. It is highly 
 likely that Wu and his group dished out their fair share of beatings to provoke 
 such planned and remorseless revenge. Second, as Wu himself commented at the 
 end of the account, because the incident was not an isolated occurrence, workers 
 in the city's factories felt that their lives were insecure and often stayed home 
 rather than risk becoming involved in factional disputes and violence. 
       Another example illustrates how the militia was mobilized to pursue 
 opponents of the "mountain top" faction. The previous chapter has recounted the 
 exploits of Zhang Jifa, a cadre from the iron and steel mill and a leader of the 
  "mountain base" faction. Zhang had been arrested in September 1974 and 
  tortured. With the assistance of Li Kechang (^5 5^ § ),51 at the time party 
  secretary of the iron and steel mill, and probably as the result of concessions 
  wrung from the leaders of the "mountain top" faction at the Beijing conference, 
  Zhang was released in early January 1975. Dissatisfied with the decision, the urban 
  militia pursued Zhang all over Hangzhou, but Li Kechang, through his contacts in 
  the bureaucracy arranged Zhang safe passage to Shanghai where he received 
  medical treatment.52 
       It is difficult to decide on the basis of the available evidence whether Beijing 
  merely ordered the dissolution of the militia command HQ or whether it banned 
                                        THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 187 

the organization itself. In addition, as the above examples illustrate, how effective 
these measures were in practice is debatable. Certainly Mao Zedong and Zhou 
Enlai differed in their approaches as to what the future of the urban militia should 
be. It is claimed that Mao "decided in early 1975 that the militia should not get 
involved in local strife between the two factions" in places such as Zhejiang and 
Yunnan.53 By contrast, the Premier went much further in questioning the need 
for militia commands at all. He believed that they only duplicated the work of 
PLA military sub-districts and county-level people's armed forces departments, 
 which had previously been responsible for organizing and training the militia.54 
       Sometime early in 1975, the Central Committee issued a document in 
 relation to Hangzhou's urban militia command which was approved by Mao,55 
 but whether it went further at that stage than reiterating Mao's vague comments, 
 is uncertain. Two sources state that the Hangzhou urban militia command was in 
 existence for ten months, which would date its disbandment in December 1974.56 
 However, given the Chinese press' notorious proclivity for vagueness, this 
 seemingly precise declaration does not exclude the possibility that the command 
 headquarters was wound up in January 1975. A Western observer has claimed that 
 the militia in Zhejiang was "officially disbanded in March 1975".57 If the term 
 militia is used to refer to the HMMCH then the claim may possibly be correct. 
 Clearly, the urban militia as an organization remained in existence at this time in 
 cities such as Hangzhou and Wenzhou. 
       The central directive ordered militia commands throughout Zhejiang to 
 hand in their weapons as the first step in curbing the violence. One place where 
 trouble continued, however, was the central Zhejiang town of Jinhua. Jinhua is 
 an important railway town on the line from Shanghai to Guangzhou via 
 Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. Disruptions at its freight-yards would 
 have serious repercussions for the movement of goods in eastern and southern 
 China. Immediately after his return to Zhejiang from the Beijing conference, 
 Zhang Yongsheng set off for Jinhua at the end of 1974. The previous March, he 
 had helped set up the militia HQ there. Now, Zhang suggested that the local 
 militia only turn over to the authorities those weapons which were defective or 
 for which they had no ammunition 58 As a result of Zhang's intervention, 
 fighting persisted in the vital transport center for a further three months, 
 paralyzing the local administration, bringing industrial production to a halt, 
 closing shops, holding up traffic, suspending postal and communication services 
 and causing injury and death 59 It is little wonder that the People's Daily and the 
 provincial media later expressed concern about the flow of railway freight through 

 Jinhua in the first quarter of 1975. 
        Between 25 February and 8 March the center convened a conference of party 
 secretaries responsible for industry to discuss problems in the railway system.60 It 
188 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

is highly likely that the CC decision on strengthening work on the railways, issued 
on 5 March 1975 as Document No. 9 (1975),61 was partly a response to the 
disruption created in Jinhua by Zhang Yongsheng and the town s militia. Another 
trouble spot was Xuzhou, a major railway junction in the north-west of Jiangsu 
province. Minister of Railways Wan Li inspected the city immediately following 
the central conference.67 Deng Xiaoping, in his speech to the conference of 5 
March 1975, devoted much of his attention to factionalism in the railway 
system.63 He deplored the alarmingly high rate of accidents experienced on the 
railways in the previous year, a more than eight-fold increase in the number 
which had occurred in 1964. Deng attributed the increase to disregard for rules and 
regulations and warned that "bad men" who "fished in troubled waters in order 
to make a name for themselves 6ft IT £ Jfr) would be severely punished.64 
The center issued another document on the railways in May and on 2 June the CC 
relayed a report from the Jiangsu authorities on its handling of factionalism at 
Xuzhou.65 
       In late May or early June the Zhejiang authorities responded somewhat 
belatedly to Document 9 and Deng Xiaoping's speech by convening a railway- 
commune joint defence meeting. It had taken three months since the central 
conference of March for the local authorities to restore order in the Zhejiang 
railway system. The meeting claimed an increase in the number of freight cars 
loaded and unloaded and a speed-up in turn-around time since the beginning of 
the second quarter of 1975. It noted particularly the situation in Jiangshan (^X ULl) 
county, Jinhua district, bordering Jiangxi province in the south-west of Zhejiang. 
Members of the PLA and public security forces were patrolling the tracks around 
the clock to prevent sabotage by "class enemies". Peasants working alongside the 
railway lines remained vigilant as they farmed. The meeting directed all localities 
to "make sure that railway transportation is smooth and free of obstructions, 
reaching all destinations safe and on time".66 
       A Xinhua report of 9 August 1975 examined the situation in the Jinhua 
railway sub-bureau.67 The article revealed that in the second quarter of 1975 
incoming and outgoing freight had doubled in quantity compared to the amount 
which had been transported in the first quarter. The reason for this startling 
increase, made deceptively impressive by the depths to which figures had 
previously plummeted, was ascribed to the "revolutionary unity" of leading 
groups at various levels, a clear indication of rampant factionalism in the sub¬ 
bureau. According to the report, veteran cadres and their youthful colleagues 
promoted in the Cultural Revolution were now working side by side in perfect 
harmony. The party organizations in the sub-bureau made arrangements for 
 cadres to go to the front line to labor and show concern for the workers' 
 livelihood. Cadres also visited workers' homes and inspected facilities at work- 
                                       THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 189 

canteens. The message spelt out very dearly in the report was that production 
could not run smoothly when workers or cadres became embroiled in arguments 
and resorted to mutual recrimination and attack. 
       However, the issue of the urban militia commands had not found resolution 
by the time the CC MAC held an important enlarged meeting from 24 June to 15 
July 1975. Deng and Ye Jianying, both Vice-chairmen of the commission, delivered 
reports to the lengthy conference.68 Deng's speech to the commission on the 
penultimate day contained withering blasts against factionalism, poor discipline 
and insubordination within the PLA. He proposed the transfer of cadres who had 
become entrenched in their localities and had been involved in local factional 
conflicts.69 As a result, it is reported that in the final four months of 1975 thirty- 
five provincial military district commanders, political commissars and deputy- 
commanders and deputy-commissars were transferred.70 According to one 
analyst, "those military officials who rose to their posts because of their 
cooperation with Jiang Qing were replaced".71 Deng also implicitly supported 
Zhou Enlai's position regarding the urban militia commands by instructing that 
these "should be settled once and for all, militia details be abolished and the 
militia should remain under the control of the military regions, provincial 
military districts and subdistricts, and the people's armed forces 
[departments]...".72 Deng is also reported to have stated bluntly that "It is not the 
role of this militia to grasp class struggle".73 
       Deng's reference to entrenched factionalism within the ranks of the PLA had 
particular relevance for Zhejiang. At the traditional annual meeting held at the 
beginning of the year to pontificate about the supposedly excellent relations 
between the army and local citizens, the provincial military leadership criticized 
its own performance in 1974. Political Commissar Li Bincheng pledged that in 
1975 "We will strive to play a more effective role in maintaining social order and 
in implementing government decrees". Li's words were a form of public apology 
for the army's failure to contain the excesses of the militia during 1974. Li also 
stated that the troops stationed in the province should strive to overcome 
"shortcomings and mistakes" in their work, a reference to the "three supports and 
two militaries" units still stationed in government, industrial and other work 
units. On behalf of the CCP ZPC, Deputy-secretary Lai Keke reciprocated by 
promising that the party authorities would do a better job of supporting the army 

than in 1974.74 
       These speeches illustrated the tensions which had appeared within the 
political-military elite in Zhejiang during 1974. The failure of local troops to 
maintain social order and implement government decrees in the province may 
have led to the transfer of outside troops to Zhejiang at about this time. The CC 
MAC conference of June/July may have decided on this initiative or action may 
190 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

have been taken earlier in the year. A report of January 1975 specifically 
mentioned the presence in Zhejiang of a battalion (£§ PH ) from Henan 
province. Whether the battalion actually came from Luoyang is unclear.75 It was 
perhaps this report and other intelligence accounts that led to the claim that 
"public security squads ... drafted in from northern China appeared on the streets 
of Hangzhou in July 1975.76 In January 1975, the political department of the ZPMD 
had issued a circular criticizing such "reactionary fallacies" as "the gun should 
command the Party" and "the Army is something special .77 It seems likely that 
these words alluded to past disobedience of party directives by the local military. 
       Thus, in late 1974 the center had attempted, with mixed results, to deal with 
the specific manifestations of factionalism, the "two crashthroughs and the urban 
militia in Zhejiang. However, the efficacy of the central decisions to solve the 
"Zhejiang problem" clearly depended on the willingness of those involved to 
adhere to their terms. Clearly, compliance had been far from forthcoming. After a 
central instruction forbidding armed struggle was relayed, Weng Senhe revealed 
the contempt in which he held directives not to his liking by remarking: "If we 
took any notice of all the rules in the world we'd perish; the same with their 
seven or eight points. I'll take responsibility". (D/fT Ir ^ - 
                                                           Wang 
Hongwen's sympathetic attitude to the "mountain top" faction at the central 
 conference had probably prompted Zhang Yongsheng to defy the decision 
instructing the militia to hand in its weapons. At the end of January 1975, when 
 the ZPC held a work meeting to convey the decisions of the CCP CC plenum and 
 the 4th NPC, Zhang accused Tan Qilong of doing a double-flip a 
 remark suggesting that Zhang and his faction had previously viewed Tan as 
 neutral in the factional battles. Zhang urged his allies to disrupt the conference 
 and took the floor in an attempt to continue the proceedings by putting Tan in the 
 dock.79 
       In December 1974 Beijing had summoned the factional adversaries to Beijing 
 in order to find a lasting solution to the problems besetting the province. These 
 problems had originated in the rebellion and factionalism accompanying the anti- 
 Lin anti-Confucius campaign, but had their roots in the upheavals of the mid 
 1960s. The immediate aftermath of the conference suggested that the center had 
 failed to grasp the nettle and that the local factionalists would be unlikely to 
 comply with its with directives which were indecisive and unenforceable. Six 
 months later the center was forced to recognize its failure by despatching a top- 
 level team to Hangzhou, this time to make on-the-spot investigations and then, 
 with the approval of the Politburo, to act decisively to quell the trouble. 
                                       THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 191 

Factionalism and Policy Direction in Zhejiang, February-June 1975 

       The CCP ZPC did not respond to the 9 February People's Daily editorial 
announcing the campaign to study the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat 
until 25 February.80 On that date it held a conference on the campaign at which 
Tan Qilong delivered a report.81 From the tenor of his remarks it is obvious that 
Tan believed that the campaign was to be merely a routine exercise which carried 
no practical policy consequences. He cited the reforms of the Cultural Revolution 
as examples of restricting bourgeois rights and then finished his speech with a 
ringing call to fulfil the modernization goals announced at the 4th NPC. Under 
the guidance of the party center. Tan led the ZPC to focus attention on economic 
matters. Even Zhang Yongsheng drafted a proposal (•(§ ) early in 1975 to 
"grasp revolution and promote production".82 
       At the end of March a provincial conference on industry was called.83 In the 
reports from the conference the study campaign merited only passing mention 
and terms expressing the new direction on the ideological front made their 
appearance. The conference pointed out that 

       we must continue to eliminate the pernicious influence of Lin Biao's 
       splittist line, strengthen revolutionary unity, oppose bourgeois 
       factionalism, strengthen proletarian Party spirit and persist in the 
       principle of grasping revolution and promoting production. 

It also called for a strengthening of Party leadership and put forward the view that 
"It is necessary to step up efforts to educate Party members and the masses in Party 
concepts and in the sense of organizational discipline The 
introduction of the term "bourgeois factionalism" signified Deng Xiaoping's 
counter-attack on the ideological battlefield. 
       A provincial "learn from Dazhai" conference held in March focused 
attention on the agricultural sector of the economy.84 The remarkable feature of 
the speeches and editorials published during the seventeen-day conference was 
the dramatic shift in emphasis which occurred after the address delivered by Chen 
Yonggui on 15 April. In his opening address on 1 April, the day of the publication 
of Zhang Chunqiao's article "On Exercising All-round Dictatorship over the 
Bourgeoisie" referred to above. Tan Qilong had delivered some strong warnings 
to the audience. Since his casual reference to it at the beginning of the previous 
month Tan had clearly been made aware of the importance of the campaign. He 
used the opportunity provided by the conference to pay homage to the theoretical 
acumen of the central radicals. Tan repeated Mao’s 1959 dictum, quoted by Yao 
Wenyuan in his article "On the Social Basis of the Lin Biao Anti-party Clique , 
that empiricism presented the main danger in the ideological realm. Tan also 
192 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

quoted sentences from Zhang Chunqiao’s tract bluntly admonishing those who 
wanted to get off the revolutionary bus before it arrived at its final destination. 
Zhang had written about the revolution that, "It's dangerous to stop half-way! 
The bourgeoisie is beckoning to you. Catch up with the ranks and continue to 

advance!"85 
      As a follow-up to Tan’s opening speech, Zhejiang Daily published two 
editorials which continued in radical theme adopted by the First Secretary. The 
first, dated 3 April, described the "learn from Dazhai movement” as a "profound 
socialist revolution" and claimed that revisionists constantly attempted to turn it 
into a production movement. It cautioned leading cadres not to forget theoretical 
issues while busy with routine tasks. The second editorial reiterated Tan's 
warning, taken from Yao Wenyuan’s article, about the dangers of empiricism.86 
       Deputy-secretary of the CCP ZPC Chen Weida delivered the main report to 
the conference on 6 April.87 However, the highlight of the proceedings was 
certainly the appearance of the legendary Chen Yonggui in Zhejiang. It was in the 
aftermath of Deng’s caustic remarks of the previous month about the harm being 
caused by factional disputes that Chen Yonggui came to Hangzhou. Although he 
was gravely ill at this time, Zhou Enlai had reportedly called Chen and Ji Dengkui 
 to his bedside to enquire about the situation in Zhejiang prior to Chen's departure 
for the south.88 Chen spent two days visiting model brigades and places of interest 
in the company of Tan Qilong and Chen Weida before addressing the 
 conference.89 In his three-part address, Chen struck an entirely different note from 
 that evident in Tan's opening speech.90 He urged his listeners 

       to study conscientiously Chairman Mao's important instruction on the 
       question of theory, adhere to the Party's basic line, relentlessly criticize 
       capitalism, vigorously build socialism, strengthen proletarian Party 
       spirit, resolutely overcome bourgeois factionalism, promote stability 
       and unity, do a good job in socialist revolution and socialist 
       construction, ... 

       Chen reserved the core of his message for the concluding sentences of the 
 third part of the lengthy speech. In a direct and frank manner he targeted 
 bourgeois factionalism in Zhejiang. He slammed those people who had ignored 
 central directives. These people, stated Chen 

       don't criticize Lin, nor Confucius, don't work, don't go to work and 
       don’t study the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat; instead they 
       link up, cause splits, and undermine the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
       If they continue in this way they will commit even greater mistakes. 

 He made it clear that those caught in the web of bourgeois factionalism included 
 members of party leading groups, members of the CCP, and those who hoped to 
 become officials by causing trouble. He challenged his audience with the question. 
                                       THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 193 

"Will you give [power] to them?" IT, 
Chen argued that not only were these people intent on obtaining power, but they 
took advantage of disturbances to graft and embezzle public funds.91 Chen praised 
the agricultural units that he had visited for their practical achievements in 
building socialism. After all, said Chen in his earthy style, even those who 
engaged in bourgeois factionalism needed to eat. The message for the rebel leaders 
in Zhejiang could not have been clearer. 
       Chen's "important report" was heard via wired broadcasts throughout the 
counties of Zhejiang.92 It was not broadcast over the provincial radio at all. It did 
not appear in Zhejiang Daily until 28 April 1975, almost a fortnight after its 
delivery. Chen's candidness, especially regarding bourgeois factionalism, was 
apparently not considered suitable for foreign ears. The published text clearly 
reveals the shift in political direction Chen's visit occasioned in Zhejiang. For 
provincial propagandists, bourgeois factionalism henceforth superseded bourgeois 
rights as their principal catch-phrase in the lexicon of political evils. 
       At the closing session of the conference on 17 April Tie Ying, Tan's deputy in 
the party, government and military, delivered the summing-up report.93 Some of 
Tie's most outspoken statements, as with those of Tan and Chen Yonggui, were 
not broadcast over the provincial radio. Tie concentrated his fire on bourgeois 
factionalism and he stated that 

       the root of bourgeois factionalism lies with the Lin Biao anti-Party 
       clique; it is the poison of the splittist line of Lin Biao and a reflection 
       among the cadres and people of the corrosion of bourgeois rights [!]. 

Tie demanded that "Leading groups at various levels must take the lead in 
overcoming bourgeois factionalism, and strengthening proletarian Party spirit and 
revolutionary unity". The contrast in emphasis and language between Tan's 
opening address and Tie's closing report was striking and significant. Tie felt 
sufficiently confident of his position, even though he had only recently returned 
to active duty after having been sidelined in semi-disgrace for most of 1974, to 
mock the radicals obsession with bourgeois rights by turning the phrase back 
against its propagators. Clearly, it was Chen's arrival that had turned the tide 
against the local radicals in Zhejiang and bolstered the position of their most 
steadfast opponents such as Tie Ying. 
       The Zhejiang Daily editorial summarizing the achievements of the 
conference reflected the tension and ambiguity in central propaganda.94 It called 
for criticism of both bourgeois rights and bourgeois factionalism, the targets of 
Jiang Qing’s radical mobilizers and Deng Xiaoping’s upholders of order 
respectively. Yet capitalist tendencies among officials were now defined more 
narrowly and concretely, and not in the more sweeping language of ideological 
deviation. An editorial published the very next day focused attention back on the 
194 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 issues of primary concern to Deng and provincial administrators alike. Zhejiang 
 Daily wrote optimistically of a "new situation" on the industrial and 
 communications front in the province and it asked leading cadres to "strengthen 
 their proletarian party spirit and combat bourgeois factionalism in order further to 

 promote stability and unity".95 

 Factionalism in 1975 

       The final section of this chapter will examine in greater detail the issue of 
 factionalism. Previous chapters of the study have commented on the open 
 admission by spokesmen from the radical wing of the CCP that factionalism was 
 the inevitable consequence of the existence of different groups within the party. 
 The logical consequences of this position, which were spelled out from time to 
 time, in 1968 and 1973 to 1974 in particular, were anathema to the mainstream 
 Leninists of the party. They believed fervently in unity and order. For this reason 
 alone they disliked and feared the factionalism spawned by the Cultural 
 Revolution and its ramifications for the future. Their spokesman in 1975 was 
 Deng Xiaoping, who has not deviated from this core belief in the fifteen years 
 which have since passed. Deng's principal argument at that time was that the 
 factionalism of 1975 differed in certain important aspects from that of the early 
 years of the Cultural Revolution.96 
        In his July 1975 speech to a study class in Beijing, Deng spoke at some length 
 of his fears concerning factionalism.97 He claimed that the factional groups then 
 in existence were of a different nature (J|£ [rJ ~f) than those formed 
 spontaneously M ffr) in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. 
 Exactly how they differed was not spelled out. In an important document drawn 
  up under Deng's aegis, scorn and vitriol were heaped on rebel factional leaders 
  and it was clearly on men such as Weng Senhe that Deng's "gunners" trained 
  their literary artillery.98 Radical theoreticians were labelled "sham Marxist 
  political swindlers", while rebels such as Zhang Yongsheng, Weng Senhe and He 
  Xianchun were described, although not by name, as "unreformed petty 
  intellectuals and ’bold elements’" 
  (flf1#?): 

        These people are politically ignorant and unexperienced [sic] in 
        production. Yet, they make the most noise, pointing their fingers and 
        calling the shots, accusing people and singing a high sounding tune, 
        but never working out concrete problems. All the time they label 
        people as "reviving tradition", falling backward", "conservative 
        forces", "pulling the cart without looking at the road" or "suppressing 
         the revolutionary zeal of the cadres and the masses".99 

         Leading provincial officials and local newspaper commentaries echoed these 
                                       THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 195 

sentiments in the following months.100 For example, Liao Zhiguo, first secretary 
of the CCP Fujian Provincial Committee, stated in an August address to 
sportsmen in Fuzhou that bourgeois factionalism opposed party leadership and 
served Lin Biao's revisionist line. In words which were almost a repetition of 
those voiced by Deng, Liao stated that 

       it is no longer in the form of small groups as it first appeared during 
       the great cultural revolution. In short, bourgeois factionalism has been 
       essentially changed.101 

Describing the struggle against bourgeois factionalism as a struggle between the 
two lines Liao was thereby viewing it as an antagonistic contradiction, which by 
definition called for suppression by the dictatorship of the proletariat. By 
implication then, the factionalism of mass organizations in the 1960s had been 
confined to the realm of contradictions among the people, to be handled by means 
of education and persuasion. 
       An ideological commentary from Heilongjiang, also in August, stated that 
 "the factionalism we are fighting against now is essentially different from that 
which formed spontaneously between the two mass organizations in the early 
 stage of the great proletarian cultural revolution". It argued that those people 
 "afflicted” with the "illness", who included leading cadres and "leaders of various 
 groups", demanded independence from the party while simultaneously fighting 
 for leadership over it. Practitioners of factionalism were warned to desist or face 
 serious consequences. In graphic words, bourgeois factionalism was portrayed as 

       an illness that is hard to cure. Bourgeois factionalism is latent, 
       changeable and obstinate in nature. If you retreat an inch ... it demands 
       a yard from you. Confronted with criticism [it] steps back and lays low; 
       after a certain period of time, when the conditions are favorable, it may 
       stage a comeback. "Bourgeois factionalism is a spring which yields only 
        to power...".102 

       Thus, certain Chinese leaders viewed the factionalism of the 1970s as being 
 different in nature and in form from the factionalism of the later 1960s. It was 
 hinted that rather than being spontaneous, factionalism in 1975 was organized, 
 directed and manipulated from above. Factional groups strove to infiltrate the 
 party so as to take control over it while simultaneously refusing to submit their 
 groups to party leadership. Some of these groups were officially-sanctioned mass 
 organizations reconstituted in 1973 or, as in the case of the urban militia 
 commands, established in 1973 and 1974. The warnings to cadres and other 
 individuals to halt their factional activities suggested also the existence of 
 clandestine groups posing a direct challenge to authority, such as the underground 

 command center in Hangzhou. 
196 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

       In Zhejiang the problem of factionalism was acute. A Zhejiang Daily editorial 
of 23 August 1975 entitled "Give a free hand in mobilizing the people to savagely 

criticize bourgeois factionalism" 
         slammed "several chiefs of bourgeois factions" as "evil people" who 
"frequently flaunt themselves as representing ’the masses', strike a pose and make 
themselves out as ’huge monsters' The editorial detailed the 
following features of "bourgeois factionalism" in the province: 
       "establishing groups and mountain strongholds, recognizing factions and not 
the party, using factions to suppress the party and stir up independence from it, 
setting up many centers, riding roughshod over party committees, weakening, 
breaking away from and opposing party leadership; 
       "differentiating between "legalist" and "Confucian”(f^ 
         groups within the party and dividing the revolutionary ranks into 
"innovators" and "restorationists"(^^^) to split the party and 
the masses and to sabotage stability and unity; 
       "drawing lines according to factions and preaching that "to rebel has merit, 
join the party to get one's share" or "whoever goes 
against the tide can join the party and become a cadre", stirring up the bourgeois 
wind of struggling for fame and advantage, exchanging flattery and favours, 
promising high posts and other favours thus creating various impurities within 
the party's organization and cadre ranks; 
       "preaching the view that at present the principal contradiction is "the 
contradiction between new and old cadres", "the contradiction between this and 
that faction" and advocating such strange theories as "you can't be wrong if you 
direct your attack at the leadership"; 
       "sermonizing about relying on some "faction" and that "we must use 
revolutionary intellectuals to reform the cadre ranks" in order to sabotage the 
party's class line of relying on the working class and uniting with other laboring 
people in the cities, and relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants and 
uniting with middle peasants in the countryside ; 
       "acting hypocritically by verbally expressing support for the party's leadership 
and the implementation of party directives while behind the scenes spreading 
rumors and slander, attacking and opposing the party's leadership, resisting party 
directives and pursuing a set of vulgar things in the manner of bourgeois 
politicians 

       "advocating the reactionary fallacy of "don't work for the wrong line", and 
smearing those cadres and masses who persist in grasping revolution and 
production as "lambs" and "mediocrities who don't understand 
politics" Gf |o]ftjjf A); 

      "shielding the class enemy thus allowing capitalism to spread unchecked.^ 
                                       THE BREAKDOWN IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 197 

      Factionalism had afflicted the industrial working class in particular. It may 
have been inflamed further by the theoretical explorations of Zhang Chunqiao, 
who seemed to be groping for a basis in Marxism to differentiate between different 
strata of the proletariat. On 14 October 1974 Zhang had reportedly stated that 
"Relying on the entire working class gives one the impression that there are no 
contradictions within the working class. That does not conform with dialectics". 
In a speech of an unspecified date, possibly at the end of 1974, Zhang had remarked 
that "We can only rely on the 'Leftists' of the working class". Furthermore, in 
February 1975, Zhang put forward the view that "The veteran workers should also 
be subjected to class analysis”.104 
       A Fujian Daily editorial of 13 July 1975 characterized attempts to establish 
factions within the working class as "a counter-revolutionary plot engineered by 
Lin Biao and company to split the Party and the revolutionary ranks".105 The 
editorial differentiated between veteran workers who, with their experience and 
longer exposure to party education, were presumably less susceptible to the 
 attraction of factional alignments than their younger, less socialized and more 
 impressionable comrades. Reports from other provinces demonstrated that 
factionalism within the working class was a widespread phenomenon.106 With 
 the State Council and its subordinate departments preparing for the beginning of a 
 new 5-Year plan in 1976, these signs of instability were disturbing indeed. 
       In his speech of July 4 Deng had also commented on the question of building 
 provincial party committees which were neither weak, lazy nor lax ($X-'!$!!-Ife )• 
 He stated that criticism of provincial committees’ mistakes was made in order to 
 help them 3fr">-107 For Deng, the 
 trouble in Zhejiang exemplified all the shortcomings that he had enumerated in 
 his speeches of the first half of 1975: weak party leadership, entrenched 
 factionalism which had entrapped party leaders, complete disregard for discipline 
 in the work-place and the involvement of the PLA in local strife. Zhejiang was 
 thus an ideal province for Deng to test his political resolve and that of his 
 colleagues on the Politburo. Disunity at the center at the beginning of 1975 had 
 compromised and aborted decisions taken at the Beijing conference, but by July 
 1975 conditions were more favorable for decisive action.
