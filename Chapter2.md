Chapter Two 


                             DISUNITY AND VIOLENCE, 
                              FEBRUARY-AUGUST 1967 


Disunity, February-May 1967 

     The rebels in Zhejiang had failed to seize power; disunity among their ranks 
had contributed greatly to this failure. In addition to the split between United 
Headquarters and Red Storm a further threatening development had materialized 
at the end of January -- the organization of a group calling itself the Red Defence 
Army of Zhejiang Provincial Worker-Peasant-Demobilized Soldiers' 
Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters (jjjff jX X ft. 'M. W A 
cja. ppiaJ^, On 20 January this organization seized the 
seals from the Xiaoshan County Public Security Bureau, located twenty kilometers 
or so from Hangzhou. On the following morning, the group repeated the 
operation in Hangzhou. Two urgent notices of 23 and 25 January reflected the 
gravity of the situation and the alarm felt by the rebels of United Headquarters.! 
     The Zhejiang Daily published editorials on 5 and 10 February calling for unity 
and warning against sabotage from the right and the ultra-left.2 In a swipe at Red 
Storm, the 5 February editorial rejected any "motley alliance" which was based on 
"conciliation, eclecticism and opportunism". The editorial of 10 February referred 
to certain people who 

      shot arrows from behind at the revolutionary rebels at a time when the 
      rebels are rallying to charge the enemy, thus disrupting the order of 
      battle and creating confusion in our own camp. 

These words gave vent to the anger that United Headquarters felt toward its 
factional enemies. 
      Despite the animosity, on 14 February United Headquarters and 30 other rebel 
groups in Hangzhou issued a proposal for unity.3 In the aftermath of the 12 
February showdown, however, the prospects seemed remote. The proposal 
advocated the establishment of a preparatory group which would make 
suggestions on how to convene a congress of the workers of Hangzhou. This 
congress would unite the city's workers as the first step in achieving the unity of 
                                                       DISUNITY AND VIOLENCE 35 

workers, peasants, cadres and students across the province. The proposal also 
recognized that without the support of the PLA all talk of power seizures was idle 
 and tacit admission of the military’s failure to support the unseating of Jiang Hua. 
      Continued squabbles among United Headquarters and Red Storm, the 
 solidarity of the provincial leaders, and the reluctance of the local military to 
 support United Headquarters, finally snapped the patience of the central 
 authorities. On March 19 the CC Military Affairs Commission (MAC) notified the 
 country of its decision to order the PLA to "support the left, industry and 
 agriculture and implement military control and military training" (the "three 
 supports and two militaries").4 Subsequently, it ordered the troops of the 20th 
 Army (Unit 6409) stationed in Jiangsu province to move into Zhejiang to assume 
 military control of the province in conjunction with the ZPMD.5 The decision to 
 send in the troops was probably made at one of a series of meetings which took 
 place in February 1967 in Beijing. 
      The most important of the sessions, those of 14 and 16 February, witnessed 
 heated clashes between senior military leaders of the CC MAC and administrators 
 of the State Council on the one side, and members of the Cultural Revolution 
 Group on the other. In the middle sat an impassive Zhou Enlai and an indecisive 
 Mao,6 responding to arguments and pressure from both sides. The crux of the 
 debate was whether to press on with the Cultural Revolution — with all the risks, 
 including the possibility of civil war — or to rein in or even abort the experiment. 
 Pressure from those who argued for the latter option was later referred to as the 
 February Countercurrent (d^ Ji£|jjt) and those involved severely 
 criticized, publicly denounced, and, in the case of Tan Zhenlin, cruelly beaten.7 
      The intervention of outside military forces in Zhejiang may have helped to 
 stabilize a chaotic situation, but it also exacerbated tensions between the two mass 
 organizations, ensnared both local military forces and outside troops in the 
 dispute, and thereby brought about tense relations between local and outside PLA 
 units. The Zhejiang Provincial Military Control Commission (jjjff 
                    which was set up either in March 19678 or more probably, 
 given the authoritative nature of the source, on 24 April,9 became the focus of 
 contention for control of the province between the ZPMD leaders and outside 
 military forces. According to its leaders. Unit 7350 (the 5th Air Force), which was 
 stationed in northern Zhejiang, had responded to Mao's order to support the left 
 in January 1967, and had most probably played a major political role in the 
 province from that time onward.10 
      Outwardly, the immediate response from the rebels to the decision 
 committing more PLA forces to the Cultural Revolution was a hearty welcome. A 
joint editorial published by Zhejiang Daily and Hangzhou Daily on 17 February11 
expressed these sentiments. It seems that United Headquarters had by this time 
36       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

received recognition from Beijing as the authorized representative of proletarian 
revolutionaries in Zhejiang. However, the editorial gave the misleading 
impression that United Headquarters possessed the unanimous and total 
endorsement of the ZPMD and all three branches of the centrally-directed PLA 
forces. This was certainly not the case. The ZPMD continued to throw its support 
behind Red Storm and the position of the naval units of the East China fleet was at 
best ambiguous. Behind the ZPMD stood the might of the Nanjing Military 
Region and its redoubtable commander Xu Shiyou, as well as the 22nd Army 
stationed on Zhoushan Island. Nevertheless, United Headquarters could count 
upon the backing of the powerful 20th Army and the 5th Air Force, whose 
 commanders were eager to display fealty to their commander, Lin Biao. 
      Official recognition of United Headquarters certainly represented a set-back 
 for Red Storm. But the knowledge that the ZPMD and its superiors in Nanjing had 
 not deserted it was a great consolation. The failure of United Headquarters to seize 
 power encouraged Red Storm to fight on, confident that its cause had a future. As 
 discussed above, it is difficult to discover substantial differences between the 
 memberships of the two mass organizations in terms of class background, 
 occupational category or other meaningful social criteria. The struggle for power 
 and survival dictated the logic of the polarization. 
      Both organizations built up a network of subordinate branches in the 
 counties and towns of Zhejiang.12 They also established contacts and liaison 
 stations in Shanghai (in particular) and Beijing. Central rebel organizations and 
 politicians in turn cultivated links in the provinces to bolster their positions, but 
 lacked the means to impose the kind of organizational discipline that the CCP had 
 always wielded over its subordinate branches. Thus, the growth of undirected 
 anomic factionalism proceeded unchecked. Factional struggles were clearly 
 upsetting the normal functioning of the economy, the agricultural sector in 
 particular.13 With the pre-Cultural Revolution power structure in complete 
 disarray it was left to the ZPMD and United Headquarters to convene a conference 
 in agricultural production at the end of February.14 
      In the meanwhile moves were in train to bring about an alliance of 
 Hangzhou's worker rebels, except for those belonging to Red Storm. An initial 
 breakthrough was achieved on 26 March when a meeting to forge such an alliance 
 opened in the city.15 The congress lasted four days and was attended and addressed 
 by leading military officials including the newly-arrived Political Commissar of 
 Unit 6409, Nan Ping, and ZPMD Political Commissar Long Qian.16 The 
 organization which emerged from these deliberations was called the Hangzhou 
 Revolutionary Committee of Workers and Staff Members (ta'J+lrjj^a^p 

          !7j ^). He Xianchun from United Headquarters emerged as one of 
 the leaders (probably Chairman) of the committee and the head of its fighting 
                                                      DISUNITY AND VIOLENCE 37 

division was Xia Genfa.17 
      The main stumbling blocks to a provincial alliance remained United 
Headquarters' insistence that it form the "core" of the revolutionary alliance, and 
Red Storm's equally strong determination that it enter on its own terms as an 
equal partner. However, an editorial in Zhejiang Daily of 21 April firmly rejected 
any concessions to or reconciliation with "conservative" organizations. It insisted 
that the "staunch revolutionary left" [United Headquarters] form the nucleus of a 
militant alliance.18 Although not referred to by name. Red Storm was accused of 
being manipulated by the "bourgeois reactionary line". Proponents of this 
position, argued the editorial, had advanced the "reactionary theory of family 
lineage" to "deceive and poison the masses". This reference is further indication of 
the "better" class composition of Red Storm and the vulnerability felt by United 
Headquarters on the issue. Unnamed "mediators", continued the editorial, had 
characterized the contradictions between mass organizations as centering on the 
issue of power. The editorial rejected such allegations, but the lengths to which it 
went in order to disprove the charge did not make its argument any more 
persuasive. It appealed to the hoodwinked members of Red Storm to abandon 
their leaders and the organization and rejoin the revolutionary ranks. Such 
appeals were to be repeated many times during the coming months, but with little 
apparent success. 
      The editorial also hinted a concern, well-founded as it eventuated, that 
United Headquarters would be ordered to form an alliance by administrative fiat. 
It rallied its members to "resolutely resist" such pressure. However as early as June 
1967 it appears that Beijing was meeting with representatives of the two mass 
organizations, as well as military officials, to force concessions from both sides.19 A 
rally held three days after the publication of the above cited editorial of 20 April 
suggested that the military did not take a united position on the question of the 
"core" of the revolutionary alliance. The representative of the 5th Air Force 
publicly aligned his unit with United Headquarters but another PLA 
representative merely proclaimed general support for proletarian 
revolutionaries.20 In an article published on 22 April United Headquarters' Zhang 
Yongsheng, inspired by the formation of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary 
Committee, called for a great alliance of rebels in the province, but he also 
excluded "conservative factions" from such an alliance.21 Zhang went to great 
lengths in his article to praise the PLA and also cited Jiang Qing’s call to "support 
the army and love the people" 
      However, in an unpublished talk of 8 April Zhang had attacked the "gun- 
toting Liu-Deng revisionist line" and had canvassed 
the possibility of peaceful evolution (^d^f j||^) within the CCP.22 At the end 
of April high-school students in the county of Zhuji, not far from Hangzhou, 
38      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

staged a sit-in and hunger strike outside the offices of the People's Armed Forces 
Department. Zhang and high-ranking military officers from Hangzhou arrived in 
early May to show their support for the students.23 Thus, in his actions and private 
talks Zhang displayed hostility toward the military, or at least sections of it, a 
stance strikingly at odds with his public utterances. 

Tension and Factional Struggle, June-July 1967 

      As the summer of 1967 approached, relations between United Headquarters 
and sections of the PLA deteriorated. A Zhejiang Daily editorial of 13 May, entitled 
 "Trust the PLA; rely on the PLA", asked the rebels to get right behind the army in 
 its "three supports and two militaries" assignment. It attributed the main force 
 units' unfamiliarity with local conditions to the brevity of their time in Zhejiang. 
 Overall, stressed the editorial, the PLA had achieved much and it exhorted the 
 rebels: 

      Do not say anything that will harm the prestige of the PLA. Do not do 
      anything that will harm the unity between the Army and the people. If 
      we find that some of the comrades in the PLA have shortcomings or 
      mistakes, we should, with sincerity and goodwill, present our 
      viewpoints on an appropriate occasion and in an appropriate way to 
      help them improve themselves.24 

 The delicacy of the phrasing could not obscure the fact that United Headquarters 
 had reason to be less than fully satisfied with the backing it had received from the 
 military up until this time. 
       In a reversal of the MAC order of 6 April, which had deprived local military 
 officials of a great deal of their civil authority and had led to the rejuvenation of 
 suppressed mass organizations,25 on 6 June Beijing directed the rebels around the 
 country to stop fighting and empowered the PLA to enforce this edict.26 United 
 Headquarters promptly convened a huge rally, attended by PLA representatives 
 and a crowd estimated at 200,000, to express its support for the order.27 
       On that same day, one of the most sensational and significant events of the 
 Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang took place.28 Weng Senhe, the worker-rebel 
 leader from the Hangzhou silk complex, had by his charisma and organizational 
 abilities become a major impediment to United Headquarters' ambitions to 
 achieve hegemony over the rebel movement in Zhejiang. Beijing's Third 
 Headquarters and United Headquarters therefore devised a plan to seize Weng in 
 order to try and force him to switch allegiance from his organization Red Storm. 
 In open defiance of the central order of 6 June, a large contingent of workers and 
 students set out for the silk complex and launched a mighty offensive against the 
  defenders inside. According to the confession written by Du Yingxin over ten years 
  later, the attack was planned by United Headquarters' leaders Zhang Yongsheng 
                                                      DISUNITY AND VIOLENCE 39 

and He Xianchun, together with the Third Headquarters' representatives in 
Hangzhou, Lin Gang and Han Xiangdong, at a meeting which they held at 
Hangzhou University on the 4th or 5th of June. The battle ended with the defeat of 
Weng’s organization. Weng himself was seized and abducted and the factory was 
left looking like a battlefield. Production ceased for almost two weeks and residents 
of Hangzhou flocked to the scene to witness for themselves evidence of the epic 
struggle and the blood spilt by Weng and his comrades. 
      Weng was held for several days on a boat on the Qiantang river and finally 
released after the intercession of the Nanjing Military Region. He returned to 
Hangzhou a hero. United Headquarters hoped to make political capital out of the 
incident by publishing Weng's extorted confession but the affair rebounded on it. 
 Red Storm's stocks soared and it gained new members while United Headquarters 
 was temporarily discredited. To extricate itself from this situation United 
 Headquarters held a large rally at Hangzhou's Youth Square on 10 June. 
 Afterwards, 10,000 marchers set out for the north of the city toward the silk 
 complex. At a bridge en route they clashed with peasants who had come out in 
 support of Weng's group. Zhang Yongsheng blamed Zhejiang University for the 
 confrontation and vowed to tear the campus apart. 
      Later in June, Zhang Chunqiao received Weng in Beijing to add his voice to 
 those urging Weng to defect.29 Weng Senhe, writing from prison many years later, 
 recalled that Zhang had expressed regret ff] 7^ rT Ies ) ~ most probably 
 at Weng having joined the Red Storm — and informed the Hangzhou rebel that he 
 had much admired his 1966 rebellion against the leadership of the silk complex.30 
 Zhang also reportedly encouraged Weng to launch attacks on the ZPMD, the 
 organization recognized as the major remaining stumbling block to United 
 Headquarters' aspirations to seize power. United Headquarters was apparently 
 aiming to secure the replacement of the leaders of the ZPMD and the military 
 control commission, Zhang Xiulong and Long Qian, with military leaders more 
 sympathetic to its cause. In return for Weng’s apostasy, guarantees concerning his 
 position in the future revolutionary power structure may have been given. 
      Other factors help explain Weng's decision to change sides. As a rebel who 
 took his revolutionary credentials seriously, Weng felt compromised by Red 
 Storm's continuing support for the "capitalist-roader" Jiang Hua, a stand virtually 
forced upon it by its backers, the ZPMD and Xu Shiyou's Nanjing Military Region. 
More opportunistically, Weng may well have seen the writing on the wall for Red 
 Storm. With United Headquarters having secured the support of the Central 
Cultural Revolution Group, the 20th Army and the 5th Air Force the chances were 
 that the plums of office would fall into its lap, leaving Red Storm isolated. A man 
of ambition, Weng would have had to consider seriously this aspect of the matter. 
      The struggle for supremacy between the two rival organizations was reaching 
40       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 a climax. On 11 June, the day after its battle with peasants m the suburbs of 
 Hangzhou, United Headquarters issued an urgent notice which stated that the 
 power struggle and attempts to arrive at a rebel alliance and a three-way alliance of 
 cadres, PLA, and mass representatives had reached a critical stage.31 It referred to a 
 "big bloody battle" against the old ZPC and provincial administration. According 
 to United Headquarters: 

      Using power which they still hold [the party authorities] fabricated lies 
       and resorted to such vicious means as awarding work points and 
       mobilizing means of transport to deceive and incite large numbers of 
       peasants to leave their production posts to go to cities to participate in 
       violent struggles, to encircle and attack the revolutionary left, and to 
       sabotage state properties.... 

 The resultant clashes had "seriously undermined production, the worker-peasant 
 alliance, and the great proletarian revolution". 
       United Headquarters requested the peasants to return to their communes and 
 direct their wrath at the power-holders rather than at the rebels. It also asked 
 peasants to reject the rewards dangled before them by local officials as bait to lure 
 them into the cities to fight against the rebels. The notice asked members of its 
 own organization to observe the guidelines of the 6 June order and to treat the 
 peasants as misguided dupes rather than as enemies.33 But United Headquarters 
 had already disregarded this order and the peasants had been told that United 
  Headquarters was a reactionary organization.33 The time for patience and 
  understanding was running out. 
       Foreign sources reported armed clashes between rebels and peasants and 
  rebels and the army during June and July 1967. While unconfirmed and perhaps 
  exaggerated, the despatches give an indication of the turmoil engulfing Zhejiang. 
  A broadcast from the Soviet Union made the sensational claim that guerrilla units 
  led by members of the ZPC and ZPMD had attacked Hangzhou from the 
  mountains killing six people and wounding another 150.34 An East European wire 
  service spoke of tens of thousands of peasants invading Hangzhou and throwing 
  their victims into the Qiantang river.35 Hong Kong sources related accounts of 
  railway workers in Jinhua, central Zhejiang, fighting with rocks, clubs and hand 
  grenades against PLA units. Another report alleged that six people had been killed 
  and fifty injured when unnamed assailants had opened fire on rebels in a 
  Hangzhou factory on 29 May.36 A Japanese report claimed that students from 
  Zhejiang University had attacked army and airforce troops.37 As if to confirm the 
  accuracy of these reports, a Central Committee document of July specifically 
  mentioned Zhejiang as a province where People’s Armed Forces Departments had 
  incited peasants to attack cities. The peasants had also interfered with the 
  movement of trains and boats and had been rewarded for their exploits.38 
                                                      DISUNITY AND VIOLENCE 41 

     Relations between United Headquarters and the PLA were also tense. A 
Zhejiang Daily editorial of 12 June warned the rebels to remain vigilant against the 
guile of power-holders who goaded them into committing "more errors" in their 
relations with the military.39 This was most probably a reference to the 11 June 
clash between peasants and United Headquarters in which the army had probably 
intervened on the side of the former. The editorial lavishly praised the PLA for its 
political skills, organization and discipline, assistance in production and for its 
efforts to raise the "revolutionary consciousness" of the rebels. It also pledged that 
mass organizations would place even greater trust in their PLA protectors. What 
United Headquarters really desired, however, was greater freedom from military 
control. This was indicated in the conclusion of the editorial, in its positive 
reference to the central orders of 28 January and 6 April curtailing the power of the 
PLA. 
      Military units supportive of United Headquarters received favorable 
publicity. Zhejiang Daily published an article praising the deeds of a unit of the 5th 
Air Force in distinguishing between revolutionary and conservative groups.40 
This squad had arrived at a chemical works in Hangzhou in March 1967 when the 
class struggle was at its most acute. It was welcomed by members of the rebel group 
affiliated with United Headquarters, who seemed to be in the minority and on the 
defensive. The factory leaders were supporting the conservative group and tried to 
convince the PLA unit to do likewise. According to the report, the military 
personnel relied on three criteria to decide which group it should support. The 
third criteria mentioned, and that of the most relevance here, was to judge each 
group not by the class background of its members but by its actual performance in 
the Cultural Revolution. This example provides further evidence that the class 
composition of United Headquarters' membership left the organization open to 
accusations that it had recruited members of "impure background" into its ranks. 
The other noteworthy aspect of the account was its revelation of the impossibility 
of the PLA's task in such circumstances. Stranger to the complexities and work 
relationships of the industrial sector, the army could not objectively decide the 
relative merits of the two contending parties. Their choice was prejudged by the 
political allegiances of their superiors. 
     United Headquarters pressed on with its search for the elusive prize of unity; 
a unity on its terms and one that guaranteed its predominance over Red Storm. 
Between 14 and 24 June United Headquarters conducted a conference to discuss 
ways of forming both an alliance of rebels and the three-way alliance of rebels, 
cadres and the military.41 The rectification of the organization's leadership work- 
style and cadre "liberation" were two prominent issues on the agenda. The cadre 
question was discussed in editorials published in June and July.42 Many cadres, it 
was announced, were victims of the "bourgeois reactionary line". They should be 
42       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

allowed to rejoin the ranks of the revolutionaries after conducting self-criticism 
 and denouncing their fellow cadres, both being proof of their commitment to the 
 new order. The rebels were warned to beware of cadres abusing the policy of 
 leniency in order to return to positions of influence. 
      Many rebels clearly opposed this shift in policy but they were informed that 
 individuals should be judged by their life’s work and not be condemned merely 
 on mistakes they may have committed in the early stages of the Cultural 
 Revolution. With policies in Beijing being determined on the basis of the arbitrary 
 dictates of the leader and his retinue, it is little wonder that erratic and sudden 
 changes of course caused consternation and confusion for those expected to 
 implement them. In Zhejiang, the failure to convince the rebels of the correctness 
 of the revised cadre policy was manifest in the absence of all leading members of 
 the defunct administration from the provincial scene. Meanwhile, supporters of 
 Jiang Hua remained active in defence of their old boss. In February 1967 they had 
 published a document entitled "Jiang Hua as reflected in the series of inner-party 
 struggles"43 to press his claims for retention in the proposed new power structure. 
 The political repercussions of this audacious step continued to make themselves 
 felt in mid-year. 
       The second issue which received prominence at this time was the work-style 
 of rebel organizations. The leading personnel of both United Headquarters and the 
 Hangzhou Workers’ Revolutionary Committee held meetings in July44 to study 
 the regulations of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee45 
 concerning standards of behavior. Both organizations passed eight point 
 resolutions on the issue. The most significant point in United Headquarters’ 
 resolution was that calling on its members to "welcome and accept criticism and 
 supervision and listen to those who hold different views and once opposed them 
 and committed mistakes". This article of the resolution could only refer to Red 
 Storm. Presumably, the military was pressing United Headquarters to make 
 concessions for the sake of unity. The accusation previously levelled against Red 
 Storm of upholding the "bourgeois reactionary line" had now been reduced to that 
 of committing mistakes. 
       It was not only the rebels who were taking stock at this time. PLA units in 
 Hangzhou also held a meeting to review their contributions which, not 
  surprisingly, they decided were positive.46 The military boasted that it had 
  correctly identified the revolutionary left and had not deviated from supporting it, 
  despite the disruptive activities of conservative organizations backed by the 
  former power-holders. The editorial which reported on the meeting made 
  reference to the "sharp and complicated" nature of the class struggle and the "very 
  delicate" nature of the PLA's mission in Zhejiang. Mistakes were inevitable in the 
  task of supporting the left, added the editorial. While "some people" were 
                                                      DISUNITY AND VIOLENCE 43 

"evasive and reluctant" to admit to their mistakes, others faced up to their errors 
and corrected them. Here, the editorial was criticizing the ZPMD and praising the 
main force units. 
      In late July and August 1967 the Cultural Revolution Group in Beijing 
launched a series of radical measures to seize back the initiative. It extended the 
campaign against Liu Shaoqi's "bourgeois headquarters" to incorporate leading 
military cadres, particularly after the outbreak of the Wuhan incident on 20 July.47 
The response to this spectacular example of provincial military insubordination 
was a strident demand for the overthrow of capitalist-roaders in the PLA. Red 
Guard leaders in Beijing despatched emissaries to various localities to increase the 
pressure on the military.48 Other violent and destabilizing incidents threatened to 
plunge the country into civil war and international disrepute. On 4 August the 
British mission in Beijing was burned down as security guards looked on 
helplessly. The troika of law enforcement agencies -- public security bureaux, 
procuratorates and courts -- came under heavy political fire and the latter two 
bodies were effectively disbanded. Members of the Cultural Revolution Group, 
who were later accused of leading a conspiratorial organization called the "May 16 
Group", published inflammatory speeches and articles to add fuel to the fire.49 
      In a speech of 22 July to rebel groups from Henan province, Jiang Qing issued 
her famous "dialectical" slogan, whose nuances were not always well understood 
by aroused young activists across China. Jiang called on rebels to "attack by reason¬ 
ing, defend by force" I;£j jit ^ )• Her followers in Zhejiang proclaimed that 
in relation to violence "first we oppose it; secondly we are not afraid of it". Using 
the kind of sophistry that characterized much of the polemics of the Cultural 
Revolution, the Zhejiang Daily put forward the argument that "To defend by force 
is to ensure that an attack by peaceful means can be successfully carried out".50 The 
stage was thus set for an open test of strength between the two rival mass 
organizations and their military allies, with rebels on both sides looting arsenals to 
arm themselves for the forthcoming battles. 
      Provincial rallies were staged on 19 and 22 July5^ to criticize Liu Shaoqi, 
"China's Khrushchev" and to denounce the leaders of the CCP HMC, including its 
former Secretary Wang Pingyi.52 Cadres were encouraged to break from their 
former superiors and publicly denounce them. At a rally on 26 July to celebrate the 
defeat of the Wuhan insurrection, a representative of United Headquarters 
launched a blistering attack on capitalist-roaders in the party, government and 
army in the presence of PLA delegates, bringing the political temperature to 
boiling point.53 

Violence in the Summer of 1967 

      The festering antagonism between Red Storm and United Headquarters 
44      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

erupted into open conflict in late July 1967. The Wuhan incident of 20 July 
provided the spark that set off the blaze. The incident provoked the center into 
dismissing local military leaders whose readiness to implement radical directives 
was questionable. On this basis a major reshuffle of the Zhejiang military 
leadership took placed On 26 August, the leaders of the Zhejiang Provincial 
Military Control Commission, Zhang Xiulong and Long Qian, were replaced at a 
"handover of power meeting" t: ) bY the Political Commissar and 
Commander respectively of the 20th Army, Nan Ping (j^#) and Xiong Yingtang 
 (j|g Zhang and Long were then subjected to "cruel persecution" 
          IS)55 for their prolonged resistance to United Headquarters and 
 assistance to Red Storm. An explanation for the dismissal of leaders of the Henan 
 Provincial Military District at about this time argued that their purge resulted from 
 an inability to distinguish "genuine proletarian revolutionaries" from false 
 ones.56 A similar inability had plagued Zhang and Long in Zhejiang and their 
 position had been under threat since April. 
      This major initiative by the center to exert control over Zhejiang was called 
 the "two reorganizations" (W't'^D'57 and signalled the end of open 
 support for Red Storm by the provincial military authorities. PLA leaders from 
 central field armies and naval and air force units now predominated in Zhejiang. 
 It has been pointed out that these forces were more reliant on allocations from 
 central resources and less tied to local conditions than the ground forces of 
 military districts.58 
       Just prior to the leadership changes in the governing military bodies, a 
 provisional leadership organ (j#f l|fi — also 
 known as the supreme organ of power Qjff ) — 
 had been established on 8 August. According to one informed source it was a body 
 unique to China's twenty-nine provincial-level administrations.59 It is unclear 
 what relationship existed between this body and the military control commission. 
 Its leadership was dominated by military personnel and presumably it functioned 
 as the administrative equivalent of the moribund provincial government. 
       During the month of August 1967 a series of violent incidents shook in Zhe¬ 
 jiang. To arm themselves for the forthcoming battles, the rebels needed weapons 
 and only the military could supply them. On the 5th and again on the 9th of 
 August Zhang Yongsheng led a thousand followers to two armories managed by 
 the military district in Hangzhou. It is highly likely that the rebels received the 
 cooperation of certain officers in getting hold of military hardware. They seized a 
 large number of pistols, signal guns, sub-machine guns, light and heavy machine- 
  guns, anti-aircraft guns, mortars, recoilless guns, flamethrowers, hand grenades, 
  ammunition and vehicles.60 This weaponry was lethal in the hands of young 
  students already practised in various forms of violence. At the end of March 1967 
                                                      DISUNITY AND VIOLENCE 45 

Zhang Yongsheng had formed a crack attack unit called the Flying Tiger Squad 
Cfcjft pjAJ which had already been tested in battle in such incidents as the 
storming of the silk mill on 6 June.61 No doubt Red Storm, with its contacts in the 
military district, also acquired its own weapons. The stage was set for a series of 
bloody confrontations across the province. 
     Although United Headquarters could claim some successes in these clashes, 
these were confined principally to operations which took place in or around 
Hangzhou. Outside the provincial capital, particularly in major provincial centers 
such as Jinhua and Wenzhou, its forces and allies suffered overwhelming defeats 
and were only saved from annihilation by the intervention of main force units.62 
Red Storm and other adversaries of United Headquarters acquitted themselves 
outstandingly. Although United Headquarters had the advantage of being 
recognized as the official Maoist revolutionary organization in Zhejiang, it seemed 
to fight a constant battle for survival against enemies on all sides. 
      The first publicized outbreaks of violence erupted at the Zhejiang Hemp Mill 
(i$Ton 16 July 196763 and at the Hangzhou silk complex on 
31 July 1967. In the latter instance a worker named Wu Fengying, who had been 
honored as an advanced silk worker, was seized on her way home from work. She 
was incarcerated in a warehouse where for two hours she was beaten and tortured. 
Her tormentors then tied her to a bed, stuffed a dirty rag in her mouth and 
violated her body with clubs. After two hours of this treatment she died. Five 
other women who belonged to the same faction were seized and thrashed, with 
their assailants shouting all the while: "CCP members must be beaten. It serves 
them right if they die”.64 Atrocities also occurred at the Hangzhou Glass Factory, 
on 19 August.65 In this incident forty people were beaten up by members of United 
Headquarters. Weng Senhe's defection to United Headquarters may well have 
provoked this outburst of factional violence as group loyalties and numbers were 
realigned in the key industrial units of Hangzhou. 
      United Headquarters’ greatest victories outside Hangzhou occurred at the 
neighboring county town of Xiaoshan and the central county of Lanxi on 26 
August 1967, the day on which the reshuffle of the military control commission 
leadership was announced. The previous day Zhejiang Daily had carried an article 
accusing the disgraced party leaders of continuing to incite peasants to attack 
cities.66 In retaliation, truckloads of workers from factories such as the Hangzhou 
Iron and Steel Works launched a raid on Xiaoshan. Five hundred workers from 
the mill participated in the attack.67 Led by Zhang Yongsheng, He Xianchun and 
Xia Genfa, the contingent struck at Xiaoshan before moving on to neighboring 
Zhuji county where innocent bystanders were shot down outside their houses.68 
      Accounts of what happened in Xiaoshan have been recorded by the county 
party committee and participants.69 According to the 1977 deposition written by 
46       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 the county committee. Nan Ping, Chen Liyun and Xiong Yingtang encouraged 
 United Headquarters to raid military arsenals at the end of July 1967. Military 
 leaders met to plan the attack and in mid August students from Hangzhou 
 University were sent to Xiaoshan to familiarize themselves with the locality. On 
 24 August an oath-taking rally was held in Hangzhou's Youth Square, followed by 
 a armed parade which was led by Zhang Yongsheng and He Xianchun standing on 
 a crane. Speakers at the rally warned of an imminent assault on Hangzhou by 
 armed peasants. At dawn on 26 August, 3,000 to 4,000 rebels from ten or so units, 
 commanded by a military officer, assembled for a three-pronged attack on the 
 county town. During the fighting they used their recently acquired flame-throwers 
 to set fire to the Xiaoshan Agricultural Machinery Factory with the losses totalling 
 243,000 yuan. 
      Wang Baozhen, a worker at the Hangzhou No. 2 Cotton Mill located in 
 Xiaoshan, claimed that many people were murdered in cold blood and others 
 tortured. An official account put the death toll at twenty-seven with many 
 injured.70 Wang's denial that she had participated in the attack on the iron and 
 steel mill, which had been instigated by former ZPC leaders, rings hollow. Six 
 workers had lost their lives in the assault and it is therefore little wonder that 
 their work-mates were determined to avenge the deaths. By proudly revealing that 
 she was a member of the factory’s militia and a recognized crack shot, Wang only 
 increases the suspicion that the assault on Xiaoshan was not unprovoked. 
       Early in 1967 workers of the cotton mill had split into two factions, with 
 United Headquarters seizing power and forcing its opponents out of the factory 
 gate.71 On the evening of 25 August, Wang Baozhen and a fellow worker were on 
 duty as medical orderlies at the county hostel. That night the hostel was 
 surrounded and the front door kicked in. Those inside were ordered to come out 
 with their arms raised and then escorted to the railway station where Wang lost 
 contact with her comrade. Later she learned that this woman was mistaken for her 
 and killed. Wang herself did not fare much better. She was beaten and interrogated 
 so that she would confess responsibility for the death of the steel workers. Her 
 captors smashed her fingers with a shifting-spanner to make sure that she would 
 never be able to use a rifle again. They wanted her to implicate the leaders of the 
 ZPMD in the bloodbath at the iron and steel mill but Wang reportedly refused, 
 even though she was stabbed in the backside with a bayonet. 
       Details of what occurred in Lanxi are more sparse.72 On 2 February 1967 the 
  mass organization linked with Red Storm, "Lanxi County Bombard the 
  Headquarters United Headquarters" seized power in the county town. Its rival 
  faction, "Lanxi County Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters" was established 
  the following June. On 13 July fierce fighting erupted between the two groups and 
  twenty-four people were killed and 138 injured when a warehouse was burnt 
                                                      DISUNITY AND VIOLENCE 47 

down. On 26 August United Headquarters launched an all-out assault on 
"Bombard the Headquarters". A further five people were killed and the latter 
group thereafter disintegrated. 
      The above incidents in which United Headquarters blitzed its factional 
opponents, were not publicized at the time. Much later these were branded 
"counter-revolutionary incidents",73 and condemned in the local press. The only 
incidents which made the headlines at the time of their occurrence were those 
resulting in losses for United Headquarters, which used its power over the media 
to gain sympathy for itself and to censure its opponents. Since the end of the 
Cultural Revolution, no condemnation has been published concerning these cases 
of violence. 
      Extraordinary incidents in which United Headquarters and its allies were 
vanquished took place further away from the provincial capital. On 3 August 
trouble broke out in the central Zhejiang town of Jinhua.74 Military forces 
stationed in the city had split over their support for different mass organizations. 
The militia intervened on the side of army units opposed to the mass organization 
which was aligned with United Headquarters. On 8 August, the day of the 
announcement of the formation of the provisional supreme organ of power, this 
body and United Headquarters held a joint press to denounce those behind the 
incident in Jinhua. The five-day interlude between the beginning of the trouble 
and the press conference may have been due to the imminent change in the 
provincial leadership. Alternatively, it may have been the result of a break in 
communications between Jinhua and Hangzhou. Or it may have reflected an 
inability on the part of the provincial leadership to arrive at a consensus as how 
best to deal with the problem. The supreme organ of power issued a notice holding 
the local party authorities in Jinhua, together with PLA units garrisoned in the 
town, responsible for summoning peasants into Jinhua to smash the rebels. The 
provincial authorities requested United Headquarters' opponents to abandon their 
organization, the Jinhua Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters 
X pfl)' and its "handful of bad leaders” who hopefully 
would confess their crimes and turn over a new leaf with a view to rejoining the 
revolutionary ranks. 
      This soft approach reflected a recognition of political reality. Without a 
massive commitment of main force troops, a step that courted the danger of an 
escalation in violence, the provincial leaders in Zhejiang could do nothing but 
compromise with their nominal subordinates. Although the representative of the 
new power-brokers in Zhejiang adopted a tough line in his speech at the press 
conference, words were no substitute for deeds and the Rebel Headquarters was 
undoubtedly aware of the strength of its position. 
      The notice of the provincial authorities was transmitted to Jinhua on 9 
48      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

August and carried the four kilometers from the normal college into town by 
students of Jinhua 2nd Headquarters the local ally of Umted 
Headquarters. The college appears to have been the group's stronghold and it must 
have been a lonely and exposed place in a sea of peasant hostility. Fighting 
continued on 10 August with the Zhejiang Daily encouraging the 2nd 
Headquarters. The editorial of the following day somewhat plaintively rebuked 
 Rebel Headquarters for challenging the hegemony of United Headquarters, which 
 it described as "the core organization of Zhejiang’s revolutionaries who have the 
 resolute support of the province". 
      At a rally in Hangzhou on 13 August, the divisions within the military over 
 the extent of its commitment to United Headquarters were in further evidence. A 
 representative of the proletarian revolutionaries, in praising the PLA’s role in 
 "supporting the left", specifically mentioned Unit 7350 but not Unit 6409. This was 
 a conspicuous omission. The commander of the Air Force unit, Bai Zongshan, 
 returning the compliment, pledged the Air Force's assistance to the beleaguered 
 revolutionaries allied to United Headquarters in both Jinhua and Wenzhou. 
 Meng Zhaoyu Bg3£), representing PL A ground forces, also pledged 
 support. Resistance in Jinhua to troops despatched from Hangzhou continued 
 until 24 August. Finally, on the afternoon of that day, a celebration rally could 
 safely be held in the city. On 25 August supporters of the 2nd Headquarters ven¬ 
 tured out from the city to stage demonstrations in two towns on the outskirts of 
 Jinhua. Resistance had finally crumbled before the superior fire-power of outside 
 military units, which had acted more to restore order and secure obedience to 
 provincial authority than to enter the lists for United Headquarters. 
       Opposition in the isolated southern port city of Wenzhou proved even more 
 difficult to subdue than in Jinhua. There was no rail link to Hangzhou, 
 communication being either by boat from Ningbo or Shanghai, rail and road from 
 Jinhua, or the narrow, mountainous and hazardous unpaved road from 
 Hangzhou. As in Jinhua the rebels affiliated with United Headquarters faced a 
 well-entrenched local administration backed by the military, the militia and a 
 population resentful of and hostile to outsiders.75 Membership of the largest mass 
 organization, the Wenzhou Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters 
              op was drawn from the city's workers 
 and suburban commune members. This faction was loyal to and supported by the 
 local party leaders. It was led by a thirty-three year-old political instructor named 
  Yao Guolin United Headquarters' followers were grouped in an 
  organization called the Wenzhou Workers' General Headquarters d£j,i|l).76 
       On 14 August 1967, United Headquarters issued a statement condemning the 
  suppression of its comrades in Wenzhou. Three days later it called a rally which 
  was attended by Nan Ping, the newly-installed head of the provincial military 
                                                      DISUNITY AND VIOLENCE 49 

control commission. On the previous day Zhou Enlai had ordered the ZPMD to 
disarm Rebel General HQ and go to the aid of its encircled opponents. The 
provisional supreme organ of power accordingly issued a circular to this effect. 
Zhejiang Daily's near-hysterical prose indicated the parlous state in which United 
Headquarters' allies found themselves. 
      The Rebel General HQ was eventually subdued by a combined force of Red 
Guards from Shanghai and Beijing, backed up on the ground by two units under 
direct orders from the central military command. By 19 August an editorial of 
Zhejiang Daily could report this news to its readers. On 20 August, at a rally held 
in Wenzhou, the commander of the units supporting the left directed members of 
the Workers’ General HQ to target the local party leader Wang Fang and to 
differentiate between the "handful of bad leaders" and the "hoodwinked masses" 
of Rebel General HQ. Wang Fang was not publicly named at the time but it is clear 
from accusations made against him in 1968 that he was the party official to whom 
speakers at the rally referred. He was accused of manipulating Rebel General HQ 
from behind the scenes and secretly instructing it to sabotage production. 
Representatives of United Headquarters and rebels in Beijing, Shanghai and 
Wuhan also spoke at the rally, indicating the extent of outside personnel involved 
in the suppression of Rebel General HQ. 
      It was clear, however, that continued resistance to the imposition of military 
control in Wenzhou worried the provincial leadership. An editorial of 21 August 
admitted that a titanic battle continued in the city and its environs. Although it 
claimed that Rebel General HQ had collapsed as an organization, its leaders 
remained obdurate. Its strength came from the support of workers in the port, 
transport, construction and other industries who had evidently stopped work, 
cutting off the city from the rest of the country. The rebel supporters of United 
Headquarters did not escape all blame for the continued upheavals and under the 
supervision of the PLA some were herded into study classes. 
      The impact of the Jinhua and Wenzhou episodes reverberated across the 
province. At a meeting of the Hangzhou Workers' Revolutionary Committee 
held late in August, accusations were heard that the "party persons in authority" 
in the two cities had "wrecked" the Cultural Revolution. Further outbreaks of 
armed struggle were reported from Wenzhou in September and October, proof 
that the situation remained highly volatile. United Headquarters may have won 
some victories but it had also suffered major losses. The overall winner from this 
spate of violent incidents was probably the military which by September was 
empowered to defend itself. 
      While the fighting and mutual recriminations of August reverberated across 
Zhejiang, rallies and editorials also preached the virtues of unity.77 It was pointed 
out that the enemy took advantage of divisions among the rebels. In an article 
50      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

putting forward the view that "all forces that can be brought together should be 
united", Zhejiang Daily offered the olive branch to Red Storm. But the sticking- 
point remained the condition that any alliance should have United Headquarters 
at its "core". The other approach, which the editorials continued to adopt, 
involved the attempt to separate the membership of Red Storm from its 
leadership and thereby weaken the organization. As one editorial stated 
condescendingly: 

      Most of the hoodwinked masses are our class brothers. When they rise 
      to rebel, we should resolutely support them. When they make progress, 
      which may be very insignificant, we should appear to be pleased and 
      give them a clapping. We should never stand in their way, ... much less 
      attack them. 

      The difficulty confronting those who espoused unity was to hit upon a 
successful method to achieve it. Unity of the two mass organizations from the top 
entailed the risk of dissent at the grassroots and the threat of boycott. Unity from 
the bottom, factory by factory and school by school, promised to be a tortuously 
slow process, subject to delay and interference. The latter approach was 
exemplified by the announcement on 25 August 1967, amid great fanfare, of the 
establishment of revolutionary committees at the Zhejiang Fine Arts College, 
Hangzhou Daily and other units where United Headquarters' strength lay.78 
Zhang Yongsheng, who had graduated from the fine arts college in 1966, was 
elected Chairman of its revolutionary committee. He boasted that Red Storm had 
not been able to recruit a single member there. As a sign of the return to normality 
the college had resumed classes on 14 July 1967.79 
      Simultaneous with the attempt to build up revolutionary committees from 
the grassroots, Beijing persisted with its efforts to impose an agreement on the two 
organizations. In August 1967 two documents to this effect had been signed, 
perhaps under duress, because events showed that local opinion was not ready for 
major concessions. Zhejiang Daily persisted in upholding the status of United 
Headquarters, enumerating its achievements and praising its steadfastness under 
pressure. To sweeten the message for Red Storm, the paper was willing to concede 
 that all organizations, no matter what their size or when they had rebelled, 
deserved equal treatment.80 Equality, that is, under the baton of United 
Headquarters. 
      By the end of August, following the harrowing month of fighting. United 
Headquarters moved to patch up its relations with the military. The latter 
 reciprocated. At a series of rallies which continued into mid-September 1967, an 
 atmosphere of mutual self-criticism and feigned modesty prevailed.81 On 31 
 August, commander Bai Zongshan asked the proletarian revolutionaries of 
 United Headquarters to criticize the mistakes which had been committed by 
                                                      DISUNITY AND VIOLENCE 51 

members of his Air Force unit. A representative of United Headquarters 
responded by saying that 

      When we were under suppression and persecution, you came to our 
      rescue and helped us to stand up, to rebel against the handful of party 
      persons in authority taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois 
      reactionaries and to gain one victory after another. 

      There was no reference to the other branches of the armed services. The rebel 
 representative also requested the Air Force personnel to "make higher and more 
 strict demands on the proletarian revolutionaries and help them to get rid of their 
 selfishness". Bai, in return, publicly committed Unit 7350 to United Headquarters' 
 demand for recognition as the "core" of any alliance. At another rally held on 1 
 September Xiong Yingtang, Commander of Unit 6409, made no such pledge on 
 behalf of his troops. On this occasion Zhang Yongsheng read out a pact of solidarity 
 with the PLA on behalf of United Headquarters. 
       At the meetings the rebels' indiscipline, factionalism and anarchy was 
 compared unfavorably with the discipline and order displayed by the military. A 
 United Headquarters' resolution, adopted on 5 September, stated in part that the 
 revolutionary masses were 

       not allowed to use any pretext to slander or put blame on the military 
       organizations. There is no excuse for them to encroach upon the 
       various kinds of weapons, equipment and supplies belonging to the 
       PLA.82 

 To back up this tough policy, the first in a series of trials conducted by military 
 tribunals took place on September 25. Four criminals were summarily tried and 
 two executed on charges of murder, arson and spying for the USA and Taiwan 83 
       Members of the central Cultural Revolution Group were rebuked for inciting 
 Red Guards to take up arms against the military and accused of forming a May 
 16" Group.84 A member of the Group, Yao Wenyuan, distanced himself from his 
 former colleagues in the article "Comments on Tao Zhu’s Two Books", which was 
 published in Hongqi and reprinted in People's Daily on September 8.85 
 Repudiation of ultra-leftism became the main task for the rebels of United 
 Headquarters. They were ordered to study Jiang Qing’s speech of September 5, 
 representing her climbdown on the utility of violence, and Yao s article.86 A 
  campaign to "support the army and love the people" commenced at the end of 

  August. 
       The battles of the summer of 1967 politically weakened United Headquarters. 
  It had been unable to eliminate its adversary Red Storm by force of arms and the 
  cost of continued factional warfare involving the army had become too great. The 
  vicious cycle of violence had to be broken; only the central leadership and Mao in 
 52      CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

particular were capable of putting an end to the civil strife which had devastated 
Zhejiang and the rest of the country.
