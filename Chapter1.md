# Chapter One - THE OUTBREAK OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, MAY 1966 - FEBRUARY 1967 

When the Cultural Revolution commenced in 1966, the provincial leadership in Zhejiang, like its counterparts elsewhere in China, faced an unprecedented set of circumstances. Polemics on the literary front, initiated by Yao Wenyuan's broadside against Wu Han's play, Hai Rui Dismissed from Office, spread to the political sphere, engulfing Beijing's municipal leadership in the process. Student unrest on campuses in the national capital expanded in scope and militancy. Calls were made for the dismissal of school administrators for unspecified but sweeping crimes including the attempt to suppress the protest. When Mao Zedong added his voice to that of the rebels by demanding the overthrow of the "bourgeois headquarters" within the CCP, it was clear that the Cultural Revolution was to go beyond the bounds of previous mass movements and political campaigns, both in its scope and method of conduct. 

With Mao’s political victory at the CCP CC 11th Plenum in August 1966, a new social force known as the Red Guards burst upon the political scene to spearhead the campaign. Initially, these young zealots targeted academics in schools and colleges as well as seeking out and destroying examples (whether architectural, written or symbolic) of the feudalistic nature of China’s culture. Next they turned their attention to party officials who had cynically manipulated the often genuine resentment that the young felt toward privilege and autocratic leadership and who had diverted it from the real power-holders -- that is, the cadres themselves. 

## The Zhejiang Political Scene 

Since 1949 Zhejiang had been ruled by cadres drawn largely from the 3rd Field Army, which had marched into the province at the beginning of that year.[^1] Many of the civilian cadres who arrived in the wake of the PLA were natives of Shandong or northern Jiangsu provinces. Local communist activists who had participated in guerrilla operations in southern Zhejiang in the early 1930s; in eastern Zhejiang first in the 1920s and later in the anti- Japanese war; or who had worked in underground party organizations in Shanghai, were, by the end of the 1950s, relegated to a secondary role in the new power structure. Senior cadres of the 3rd Field Army such as Tan Zhenlin (谭震林) and Tan Qilong served in the province during the early post-Liberation years of reconstruction. After Tan Qilong s transfer in 1954, his deputy, Jiang Hua,[^2] became the paramount leader of Zhejiang. 

Through his lengthy tenure in Zhejiang, Jiang Hua had, by the mid-1960s, built up a powerful network of loyal subordinates within the provincial party leadership. His closest and most trusted colleagues were placed in key bureaucratic posts in the political/legal network, the propaganda department and central office registry. Jiang's wife, Wu Zhonglian(吴仲廉) had held the important positions of head of the ZPC Political and Legal Group and President of the provincial Supreme Court since the mid-1950s. Wang Fang(王芳)[^4], who was Deputy-governor and entrusted with overall responsibility for public security work in Zhejiang, was assisted by the Minister for Public Security, Lii Jianguang (吕剑光)[^5] 

Another close associate of Jiang’s was Xue Ju (薛驹), who held the post of Director of the ZPC General Office from where he could oversee the flow of documents and correspondence. Xue had commenced work in Zhejiang in 1947.[^6] Chen Bing (陈冰) known as the master of the pen (笔杆子), headed the Propaganda Department. Chen Weida (陈伟达) who had been a member of the provincial party secretariat since 1959, was responsible for the implementation of agricultural policy. Zhejiang's regular grain surpluses provided Jiang with bargaining power vis-à-vis the central authorities to obtain funds for the development of the province.[^7] 
      
Two of the remaining members of the ZPC secretariat, Li Fengping(李丰平) and Wu Xian (吴宪), had served under Jiang since 1954, Li having spent a three-year interregnum in the neighboring province of Anhui between 1963 and 1966.[^8] Lai Keke (赖可可) was the most recent addition to this elite, having been promoted in 1964 from his post of Secretary-general of the CCP ZPC. Lai’s career had suffered a serious setback in 1953 as a result of his involvement in conspiratorial plans drawn up by Gao Gang and Rao Shushi to reshuffle the central leadership directly below Mao. After his demotion in 1953-54, Lai’s transfer to Zhejiang in 1961 marked a new phase in his career.[^9] Significantly, he was the only member of the ZPC secretariat to have suffered the ignominy of demotion before the Cultural Revolution. 

Another more recent arrival in Zhejiang was Cao Xiangren who had been appointed to the ZPC secretariat in 1959. He had previously served as China's ambassador to Bulgaria (1950-54) and Deputy-minister of the First Ministry of Machine-building (1955-59). His transfer to Zhejiang perhaps signified a central decision to devote more attention and expertise to the development of industry in the province. It is alleged that Cao found some difficulty working with the rough, blunt, domineering Jiang. For whatever reason, it is significant that Cao and Lai alone broke ranks with Jiang's leadership team when the ZPC came under direct attack from the rebels at the end of 1966. And in January 1967 Cao displayed personal malice toward Jiang by publicly demanding Wu Zhonglian's posthumous expulsion from the CCP.[^10]

Thus, at the beginning of 1966, Jiang Hua led a team of experienced politicians most of whom had worked together for the previous decade. Jiang had several times displayed his commitment to upholding central policy: in his purge of localists in 1957-58,[^11] his enthusiastic espousal of both the Great Leap Forward program[^12] and the policies of readjustment which followed.[^13] Jiang was the perfect example of the provincial politician of the time, the middleman par excellence, who, in the words of the leading analyst of the phenomenon 

> is a man eminently sensitive to shifting winds from Beijing. Although jealous of provincial interests, he is careful to tailor his articulation of those interests to the prevailing policy line. He emphasizes the primacy of national interest and shapes provincial policy according to central directives. When the provincial politician errs, it is more likely by going too far in implementing "infallible" central policies than by opposing them.[^14] 

## The Beginnings of the Cultural Revolution 

Two interpretations of the response of provincial officials to the unfolding of events in 1966 have been put forward. One view, enunciated by Parris Chang[^15] and applied to Sichuan province by T. J. Mathews,[^16] has described the response as, in Chang's phrase, "strategies for survival". Chang writes on the assumption that provincial officials were intent on resisting the Cultural Revolution. In the initial phase, according to Chang, provincial leaders adopted such strategies as evasion and diversion, deception and containment. After the August 1966 plenum these strategies no longer remained viable and sheer survival, physical and political, became of paramount importance. Summoning all the resources at their disposal, provincial party officials sought support and protection from their comrades in provincial military garrisons, lobbied patrons in Beijing, bought off under-privileged groups among workers and peasants by offering them bonuses and subsidies and even resorted to suppression of their rebel challengers. Chang concludes, admiringly. 

> The fact that it was the use of military forces that finally brought down the recalcitrant well-entrenched provincial Party leaders attests to the remarkable effectiveness of their survival strategies.[^17] 

Another, more subtle interpretation of the response of provincial officials has been advanced by Andrew Walder.[^18] Based on a study of Shanghai for the period 1966-67, he argues persuasively that local officials, at least in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, responded obediently to Mao's initiatives even when they did not fully comprehend the raison d'etre behind the campaign. The provincial politicians did their best to move with the constantly expanding parameters of Beijing's dictates.[^19] Teiwes' description of provincial leaders, cited above, would strongly suggest such a course of action. But, argues Walder, the momentum of the Cultural Revolution left provincial politicians floundering in its wake and eventually they lost all control over local events. In Walder's view, various social groups needed no incitement from party officials to put forward particularistic demands in an environment where social order and industrial discipline had collapsed. Nor was it surprising that undirected student groups should splinter and engage in increasingly violent actions and internecine confrontation. In short, responsibility for the social and political chaos in the localities lay not with obstructionist acts committed by insubordinate officials, as suggested by Chang, but rather with the increased scope allowed for centrally- inspired and authorized attacks on local political authority. 

The passage of time has tended to confirm the accuracy of Walder's explanation. Certainly, it conforms more closely to the unfolding situation in Zhejiang.[^20] Nevertheless, it bestows on provincial officials too large a measure of political good intention. As a group they were grappling with a crisis of enormous dimensions.Their most senior member, Peng Zhen, had already lost his posts in Beijing. Precedent, established party norms,[^21] experience and common sense all seemed of little assistance to them and it would have been surprising if desperate circumstances had not produced novel counter-measures. What is certain is that Jiang Hua's spirited and multi-faceted fight for survival, whatever its motivations, had important consequences for the future of the Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang. Moreover, Jiang, like his counterparts in other provincial administrations, linked his fate with that of the CCP. Was he not the party's principal representative in Zhejiang and was not any attack on his leadership in effect an assault on the party itself, and hence counter-revolutionary? 

Presumably, Mao's presence in Hangzhou in 1966 for such crucial meetings as the May enlarged Politburo meeting, which drew up the May 16 Circular directing the Cultural Revolution into the political realm, provided Jiang with the opportunity to gauge the Chairman's mood and intentions. This access to Mao and his entourage was not enjoyed by Jiang's colleagues in other provinces. The question arises whether Jiang used the Chairman’s proximity,[^22] his contacts in Shanghai - where the East China Bureau of the CCP (of which he was a member) was located and where the Zhejiang provincial government maintained an office[^23] -- to discover Mao's intentions in order to promote or sabotage the unfolding Cultural Revolution. 

Jiang had powerful patrons in Beijing to assist him assess and adapt to the new situation. The most important of these was Tan Zhenlin. Like Jiang, Tan was an old associate of Mao's dating back to the days on the Jinggang mountains. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution he was a member of the Politburo, Vice¬ 

  premier of the State Council and Director of its office of agriculture and forestry.24 
  Tan had been the first post-1949 provincial leader of Zhejiang until his transfer to 
  Jiangsu province in 1952. At that time Jiang served under Tan as a member of the 
  CCP ZPC standing committee and as Second Deputy-secretary.25 After his transfer 
  to Beijing, Tan retained strong personal and institutional links with his old 
  province and the whole of East China. However, the maintenance of close 
  relations with powerful central politicians was a two-edged sword. While central 
  patrons remained in good standing with Mao, the benefits were passed on to their 
  followers; but once they fell into disfavor all their close associates were implicated. 
   Zhao Ziyang basked in the glory of Tao Zhu's meteoric rise in Beijing in 1966 and 
   shared in full the consequences of his disgrace at the end of that year.26 Similarly, 
   the reverberations accompanying Tan Zhenlin's fall in February 1967 were felt in 

   East China. 
20        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

      The acuteness of Jiang Hua's political sensitivities may well have been put to 
the test in November 1965. In that month Yao Wenyuan’s article criticizing Wu 
Han's play was published in Shanghai. Mao ordered other localities to republish 
the piece2'7 and Jiang responded by ordering Zhejiang Daily to print it on 24 
November, a fortnight later. Thus, Zhejiang had beaten other localities such as 
Beijing and Guangzhou in its response to Mao's instructions.28 A Red Guard 
publication subsequently charged Jiang with political opportunism by using his 
contacts in Shanghai to discover the strategic implications behind Yao's article.29 
Equally credible is the possibility that by his promptness in republishing Yao’s 
article, Jiang was ensuring that his loyalty to Mao remained unopen to doubt. 
      The same Cultural Revolution source also claimed that Jiang obtained an 
advance draft of the May 16 circular which enabled him, in collaboration with the 
noted theorist Hu Qiaomu, to instruct Chen Bing to publish three articles under 
the pen-name of Xin Wenbing These articles attacked the Beijing 
"Three Family Village" writing team operating under Peng Zhen's aegis.30 
However, the most sensational accusation levelled at Jiang was that early in 1966 
he ordered Lii Jianguang, together with public security officials from Beijing, to 
spy on Mao. They allegedly emptied Mao's wastepaper baskets for scraps of 
information, eavesdropped on his conversations, bugged his residence and tapped 
his telephone calls. This story, apocryphal though it may be, was to have far- 
reaching consequences for those allegedly involved.31 

Jiang Hua and the Cultural Revolution, 1966-67 

       Between June and July 1966 Jiang faithfully implemented central directives 
concerning the conduct of the Cultural Revolution issued by Liu Shaoqi and the 
Central Committee. Work teams were sent out in mid-June and recalled, on Mao's 
instructions, at the end of July.32 In Zhejiang the work teams were under the 
overall leadership of Chen Bing who had been appointed Director of the 
provincial Cultural Revolution Group.33 Liu Dan, one of the leading party officials 
and administrators at the prestigious Zhejiang University, and the head of its 
Cultural Revolution Group, was dismissed at a public rally on 22 June. The 
meeting was held on campus and attended by Cao Xiangren, representing the CCP 
ZPC.34 Liu was charged with investigating the class backgrounds of students who 
had pasted up wall posters and excluding those lacking the right family 
background from further participation in the campaign. A Taiwan report alleged 
that Jiang Hua himself was behind this investigation of the students' class 
background.35 If these accusations were true they prove that Liu Dan and Jiang 
were implementing the party's class line. That this line changed and Liu’s 
diligence brought about his downfall illustrated the volatility and unpredictability 
                                    OUTBREAK OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION 21 


of the political situation at the time. In the light of later events, the ZPCs decision 
to dismiss Liu on these grounds appears to have been one that appealed to the 
increasingly militant Red Guard organizations. They were demanding that 
membership not be restricted to children of the "five red" categories of worker, 
peasant, cadre, soldier and revolutionary martyr. Selected sacrificial victims in the 
propaganda and cultural systems were also dismissed and vilified at this time.36 
       To retain the initiative, on 26 June Jiang delivered a major address before a 
 gathering of 10,000 CCP members and a full complement of party and military 
 leaders. In his oration on the topic of Mao Zedong Thought37 Jiang explained the 
 significance of the Cultural Revolution as an ideological and political class struggle 
 against both representatives of the bourgeoisie in the CCP and bourgeois 
 intellectuals. He cautioned those who practised political deception by waving the 
 red banner only to oppose it ~ a warning no doubt delivered in all sincerity but 

 one that before long would rebound on its speaker. 
        The first major challenge that Jiang Hua and his colleagues faced arose from 
 the formation of local Red Guards and the arrival of Red Guard emissaries from 
 Beijing to check and supervise the progress of the Cultural Revolution in the 
 province38 For the CCP ZPC, the principal dilemma at this time was how to keep 
  in step with the center by implementing a set of ill-defined, almost 
  incomprehensible directives, while at the same time carrying on with everyday 
  administration, which was rendered increasingly difficult by the implementation 
  of these very same directives. The presence of Red Guards to check on the party 
  committee's performance made such time-honored tactics as prevarication, 
  distortion or feigned compliance both difficult and politically risky. 
         A Yugoslav correspondent stationed in Beijing reported that at the 11th 
  Plenum the East China delegates voted as a block for Mao's Cultural Revolution, 
  thereby helping the Chairman carry the day in a tight situation.39 This gesture may 
  have impressed Mao but soon after the plenum Jiang faced the disruptive 
  activities of Red Guards. Their first public appearance was on 23 August when they 
  were joined in street marches by workers and peasants from suburban 
  communes.40 In their first attack on the "four olds" the youthful iconoclasts 
  marched around Hangzhou changing the names of streets, restaurants and public 
  buildings and destroying precious cultural relics in the historic city.41 By 
  September Red Guards from Beijing and elsewhere had arrived in Hangzhou to 
  push along their more "backward" fellow-students in the provinces. At two 
  meetings with the provincial leadership they submitted suggestions concerning its 
  conduct of the campaign and gave initial approval of its performance. Red Guards 
  from outside Zhejiang attended the first meeting, while those from within the 
  province were present at the second.43 Jiang Hua's presence at these meetings were 
  his last recorded public appearances in Zhejiang during the Cultural Revolution. 
22        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

       By the autumn of 1966 the Hangzhou Tertiary and Secondary Schools' Red 

Guards Headquarters 'J’H ^ £1J2 £ ) had sPUt 
 into three major groups.43 The first of the groups was Red Storm (£1#^), 
 which was based at Zhejiang University and led by Liu Ying (£lj and Teng 
 Zhu Jinggang Mountain (#|xj|i|), the least influential of the 
 three organizations, occupied the middle ground but tended to side with Red 
 Storm in the clashes which this group became involved in with its principal rival. 
 Red Third Headquarters (£IH^J). Red Third HQ found its strongest support 
 at Hangzhou University and the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts. Its leaders were 
 Li Xiantong ” a student from Hangzhou University’s Department of 
 Foreign Languages -- and Du Yingxin and Zhang Yongsheng — a 
 young teacher and graduate student, respectively, from the Academy. In a letter of 
 5 July 1966 Zhang had described his college as a black gang’s den where he had 
 waged struggles for six years. He also complained of the incessant persecution he 
 had suffered at the hands of the demons (J§ f|) who controlled the college.44 
 It is alleged that the Red Guard leaders at Zhejiang University held little respect 
 for Zhang Yongsheng and personal antagonisms had played an important part in 
 the disintegration of the original Red Guard HQ.45 
        It appears that shortly after its formation Red Storm established contact with 
 senior provincial leaders. For example, it was alleged in a publication from a rival 
 group at Zhejiang University that Jiang Hua’s deputy, Li Fengping, supported the 
 organization and a Taiwan source included Jiang Hua and Chen Weida as backers 
 of Red Storm.46 When a contingent from Red Third Headquarters marched upon 
 the famous Buddhist monastery and temple of Lingyin students 
 from Red Storm at neighboring Zhejiang University, acting on Zhou Enlai’s 
 instructions, blocked the road to save the building from destruction. Presumably, 
 Zhou had directed the provincial leaders to mobilize Red Storm knowing of their 
 contacts and influence with the organization. Zhejiang University student links 
 with the provincial party leadership may have dated back to June 1966, when the 
 ZPC had supported students there in their rebellion against the university 
 leaders.47 

        Red Third Headquarters, by its choice of name, clearly identified itself with 
 the most radical of the Beijing Red Guard organizations. Third Headquarters. In 
 Julianna Heaslet’s categorization of students groups Third Headquarters belonged 
 to the category described retrospectively as "Mao and Lin’s political 
 hatchetmen".48 Its counterpart in Zhejiang likewise belonged to this camp. Red 
 Storm belonged to the category that defended provincial leaders when the latter 
 came under attack late in 1966 49 However, such a simplistic differentiation is 
 misleading and inaccurate. Both Red Third HQ and Red Storm, like their 
 counterparts across China, claimed to be loyal followers of Chairman Mao and 
                                    OUTBREAK OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION 23 


went to extreme lengths to prove their loyalty. To Red Storm and other 
organizations later labeled "conservative", their provincial leaders were the local 
spokesmen and representatives of the Chairman and the CCP and to question 
their revolutionary credentials was tantamount to counter-revolutionary 

behavior.

        At about the same time as the split among Red Guard groups, Jiang Hua had 
 withdrawn from public duties, leaving his principal subordinate Li Fengping in 
 charge of the provincial party committee. By October 1966, provincial party 
 committees were virtually inoperative, with the number of leading cadres making 
  public appearances decreasing all the time. Li Fengping was present at the 1966 
  National Day rally and at a struggle rally against a leading provincial cadre on 5 
  January 1967.50 Thereafter, he also disappeared from public view. Cao Xiangren 
  and Shen Ce both members of the ZPC Standing Committee were 
  present at a report meeting on the study of Mao's works held in late October.51 But 
  a Red Guard from Fujian, who was in Hangzhou at this time, reported that "All 
  West Lake was now the world of the Red Guards and the military 52 And it was 
  true that the military was forced increasingly to take on responsibility for civilian 

  administration. 
         When the ZPMD convened a provincial congress of PLA activists in the 
  study of Mao Zedong Thought between 7 and 16 October53 the principal speakers 
  were ZPC Secretary Wu Xian, ZPMD Commander Zhang Xiulong (&##) 
  and Political Commissar Long Qian (##)-54 It is highly likely that the above 
  military officials were acting as Jiang Hua's surrogates, as there was a close 
  relationship between provincial civil and military authorities at this time.55 The 
  close institutional and personnel relationships between the civilian and military 
  wings of the CCP would prove a major obstacle to the rebels when they attempted 
24       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

to seize power in 1967. The rebels themselves were acutely aware of the close 
relations between local military and civilian party leaders. The issue was discussed 
in a meeting of the Red Guards in December 1966. Zhang Yongsheng from Red 
Third Headquarters pointed out that many of the members of work teams sent 
onto campuses in June and July 1966 had come from the military district. After 
discussions with Red Guards at Zhejiang University, Han Xiangdong 
(Hf&J/fc), a stucient from Qinghua University and a representative of 
Beijing's Third Headquarters, argued that the ZPMD had close ties with the ZPC 
and that both had close relations with the "conservative faction" (Red Storm). He 
concluded that the key to "solving the problem of the ZPC" lay with the military 
district. As Zhang Yongsheng pointed out in January 1967, his faction would find 
its military protectors elsewhere in the shape of the 20th Army and 5th Air 
Force.56 
      As First Political Commissar of the ZPMD, Jiang had strong institutional and 
personal ties with his military colleagues, notwithstanding his derogatory remarks 
concerning their capabilities.57 Political Commissar Long Qian also served as a 
member of the ZPC Standing Committee and both he and Commander Zhang 
Xiulong had accumulated a substantial period of service in Zhejiang. It was not 
only at the top of the provincial hierarchy that the two bureaucracies overlapped. 
At the district, county and commune levels, civilian and military leadership 
coexisted on intimate terms, an administrative arrangement of momentous 
importance when the rebels left the relative safety of provincial capitals to unseat 
"local emperors" in towns and villages. 
      Nevertheless, Jiang's political position and authority were being rapidly 
undermined. The October 1966 Central Work Conference in Beijing decided to 
press ahead with the Cultural Revolution and to expand its scope from the 
educational sphere into offices, factories and communes. Jiang Hua continued to 
fight for his political life. A "Zhejiang delegation of veteran conservatives" 
arrived in the national capital in October to report that the situation in the 
province was similar to that prevailing on the eve of the anti-rightist movement 
in 1957. Tan Zhenlin's wife, Ge Huimin, reportedly relayed her husband's 
instructions to the delegation.58 Tan also interceded with the central authorities to 
argue for Jiang Hua's continuation in power.59 

Power Seizures 

      Rebel delegations of workers also traveled to Beijing to appeal for support in 
their efforts to overthrow local power-holders. On 17 November 1966 the 
country's first worker-delegation was received by two members of the Cultural 
Revolution Group, Yao Wenyuan and Wang Li.60 It comprised employees from 
the city’s largest silk mill, the Hangzhou Silk Printing and Dyeing Complex (ft 
                                   OUTBREAK OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION 25 

                                The leader of the delegation was Weng Senhe, 
who was to become the most notorious rebel from Hangzhou in the Cultural 
Revolution and who later stood second in fame nationally only to Wang 

Hongwen.62 
      On 16 January Weng’s rebel group the Red Rebel Corps (£t 
0), had seized power at the silk complex. As early as June 1966 Weng, a 30 year- 
old screen printer, had put up a big character poster rebelling against the factory 
leadership.63 Weng, who had received three years' secondary schooling, had 
originally been a clerk at a township office in Zhejiang.64 For unknown 
reasons he was the beneficiary of the much sought-after transfer to a large city. In 
1962 Weng was assigned to work at the Hangzhou Chemical Fibre Plant65 and 
then, in 1963, he was transferred to the silk complex. In 1965, during the Socialist 
Education Movement, he was reportedly reprimanded for speculative activities.66 
This experience gave rise to feelings of resentment against the factory leadership 
and the political and social system in general. Weng reportedly regarded a 
worker's existence as meaningless62 and spent his leisure hpurs studying the 
careers of such twentieth century notables as Hitler and Mussolini.66 When the 
Cultural Revolution commenced Weng reportedly proclaimed that "the reds of 
 the past seventeen years must stand aside; those who have been oppressed, unite 

 and rebel".69 
       Weng’s June rebellion took considerable time to gather momentum. At the 
 beginning of December 1966 only 45 workers in the complex had committed 
 themselves to his cause. Workers of good class background and those on higher 
 pay and with better skills tended to support the factory leadership. Weng could 
 only attract those of lower status in the socialist class pecking order. The party 
 leadership in turn maligned Weng's group as rightists and, to protect its position, 
 suddenly admitted more workers into the CCP and trade union.70 However, by 
 the middle of December 1966 the rebels had attracted enough workers to hold their 
 first meeting and, by the time they convened their second meeting, the party 

 leaders felt sufficiently threatened to disrupt it. 
        Eventually, the authorities were overwhelmed by the rebels who, benefiting 
 from Weng’s undoubted leadership skills, finally seized power. They were also 
 assisted by the unprecedented nature of the political campaign71 and the kudos 
 that daredevils such as Weng accrued for the persecution they had suffered 
 several months before. Previously labeled an "anti-party" trouble-maker, Weng 
 was vindicated and praised for his actions. Ironically however, the rebels' first task 
 on taking over the seals of office was to try and resume normal production - a 
 goal that the erstwhile management had been striving unsuccessfully to 
 accomplish. The rebels then issued the call popularized by Zhou Enlai to grasp 

 revolution and promote production".72 
26       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

      On 9 January 1967 one of the most celebrated (or infamous) events of the 
Cultural Revolution occurred with the overthrow of the party and government 
leadership in Shanghai. The "January Storm" (— RH)/ as this month of 
power seizures became known, rapidly spread to other parts of China.73 Situated 
in close proximity to the giant metropolis, Zhejiang immediately felt the waves of 
this extraordinary upheaval. Over the previous two months, workers at industrial 
plants and employees in government offices and various trades had established 
their own unit-based groups. The state of social disorder had provided them with 
the unprecedented opportunity to visit other units for the purpose of seeking out 
and making contacts with like-minded organizations. Such linkages were in turn 
utilized to bolster each organization's own position and were drawn on to fight off 
challenges from opposing groups. Cross-unit ties led to the formation of umbrella 
organizations spanning schools, colleges, factories and offices. 
       On 9 November the Shanghai Workers’ Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters 
had been formed under the leadership of Wang Hongwen, a security officer at the 
city's No. 17 cotton mill. A similar process occurred in Zhejiang. In fact it is 
claimed that Weng Senhe was the first worker rebel leader in the Cultural 
Revolution to organize a General Headquarters (£j, t?J 1$) of worker 
rebels.74 By the end of 1966 Red Storm had expanded from its base at Zhejiang 
University to encompass a large number of factories in the light industrial textile 
 district of Gongshu in the north of Hangzhou. This organization took 
 the name of Zhejiang Provincial Red Storm Provisional Headquarters and it is 
 alleged that the leaders of the CCP ZPC were responsible for its establishment.75 
       A rival organization, whose student component was supplied by Red Third 
 Headquarters, included workers from heavy industrial plants such as the 
 Hangzhou Iron and Steel Mill (^rC ) and the Hangzhou Glass 
 Factory situated further to the north of Hangzhou in the industrial district of 
 Banshan (-=£[JL|). This organization, which was formally established on 30 
 December 196676 as an alliance of twenty-two rebel organizations, named itself the 
 Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters. Each factory and 
 college sent a delegate to the parent organization. To proclaim its formation, 
 Zhang Yongsheng led a contingent to storm the downtown building housing 
 Zhejiang Daily and closed down the newspaper, which did not reappear until 10 
 January 1967.77 

        The leaders of United Headquarters were the students Zhang Yongsheng and 
 Li Xiantong, already referred to as joint supremos of Red Third Headquarters. 
 Because of a socially less acceptable class background and because of his 
 unorthodox social behavior Du Yingxin, although he was reportedly more capable 
 than Zhang, did not achieve the prominence his abilities would have otherwise 
 warranted.78 Worker rebels who were prominent in the organization were He

from the Hangzhou Oxygen Generator Plant (^rv. ’J+| -tit J-)/ Guo 
Zhisong (|P *£ $) from the Zhejiang Construction Company and Ye Rende 
              from the iron and steel mill.79 Red Storm's leadership included the 
 two student leaders Liu Ying and Teng Zhu from Zhejiang University and the 
 workers Weng Senhe and Huang Yintang from the Hangzhou silk 

 complex80 and Fang Jianwen (73 $J;£) from the Hangzhou No. 1 Cotton 

 Textile and Dyeing Mill (^fCtl'lD■ 
        What is striking about Red Storm's full name is the word "provisional" as 
 well as the absence of the virtually obligatory "rebel" qualifier. In its composition 
 and outlook Red Storm somewhat resembled Liu Guokai's description of 
 organizations comprising members of "high political quality". By contrast. United 
 Headquarters seems to have contained more members of "low political quality" 
 who were more extreme in their actions and designated themselves 
 "revolutionary rebels".81 Yet the distinction was never so neat. Whether the 
 fanaticism of both groups reflected the composition of their memberships and 
 socio-economic circumstances specific to Hangzhou, or both factors, is unclear. It is 
 clear, however, that neither United Headquarters nor Red Storm placed workers' 
 economic grievances high on their list of priorities although they may have 
  supported such demands when it suited them. Action in support of such demands 
  was condemned as a manifestation of economism, or what Walder has aptly 

  described as "interest-group radicalism" 82 
        The significance of the geographic and sectional division between the two 
  rebel organizations is also difficult to assess. It may not have been as clear-cut as 
  the above description suggests. At first glance Red Storm seemed to have built up 
  a more substantial base in a city where light and textile industries were relatively 
  developed. But women comprised a large proportion of the employees in this 
  sector and in the Cultural Revolution the bulk of the fighting was undertaken by 
  men. The sheer weight of numbers on the streets often counted a great deal. 
  Additionally, there may have been more temporary and contract workers in the 
  heavy industrial sector, another factor which worked to United Headquarters' 
  advantage. Such speculation may go some of the way to understanding the 

  relative strength of the two organizations. 
         As 1966 drew to a close the provincial authorities found themselves in a no- 
  win situation. Demands for pay increases, improved working conditions and a 
  change in the terms of employment from temporary or contract to permanent 
  status, with all the accompanying benefits, security and rights, proliferated. In 
  order to place further pressure on local leaders, central radicals such as Jiang Qing 
  momentarily and opportunistically expressed support for such demands. If 
  provincial leaders acceded to such claims they were accused of inciting 
28        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

economism or encouraging strikes to buy off the workers. On the other hand, if 
local leaders refused to give in to particularistic demands they were charged with 
condoning exploitation and inequity. The new military-dominated 
administrations which were established in the wake of failed power seizures early 
in 1967 faced the same dilemma, but they were more ruthless in suppressing 
interest-group demands.83 Nevertheless, accusations that officials deliberately 
provoked and then submitted to economistic demands, so as to bankrupt the state 
treasury and sabotage the Cultural Revolution, continued to be made.84 Even 
rebel groups, vociferous in their condemnation of economism, succumbed to the 

lure of emoluments in cash and kind.85 
       On 20 January and 1 February 1967 United Headquarters, together with other 
rebel groups, issued urgent notices calling for a cessation of economism in rural 
 areas.86 The notice of 20 January gave some indication of the intense struggle then 
 in progress in the province. It accused the power-holders of provoking peasants to 
 reject state requisition policies and fight among themselves. Commune collective 
 funds were being distributed to individual peasants, who had also withdrawn 
 large sums from banks and credit cooperatives. The circular directed groups such 
 as rusticated educated youth, who had taken advantage of the breakdown in social 
 order to return to the cities, to go back to the countryside. Requests to local 
 military and militia forces to protect mass organizations, and not beat and detain 
 their members, revealed the attitude of the powerful rural armed forces toward 
 the rebels. 
 At this critical stage of the Cultural Revolution both Red Storm and United 
 Headquarters were striving to gain official recognition from the central Cultural 
 Revolution Group. With Beijing calling for the unseating of capitalist-roaders 
 across the country, each individual seizure of power would assist the rebel group 
 responsible obtain such approval.

The Downfall of Jiang Hua 

       Rebellion in factories and offices was a mere side-show compared to the 
 challenge of removing the CCP ZPC from power. With the successful overthrow 
 of the Shanghai municipal authorities in mid-January 1967, the central authorities 
 issued a call to "proletarian revolutionaries" on 20 January to "form a great 
 alliance to seize power from those in authority who are taking the capitalist road". 
 The problem of deciding which provincial leaders were following the capitalist 
 road remained one for local rebels to thrash out, and it proved as difficult to judge 

 in Zhejiang as elsewhere in China. 
        The first struggle rally organized against a senior member of the ZPC elite 
 took place on 5 January 1967. The principal target was Chen Bing, one of Jiang 
 Hua’s closest subordinates and appointed by Jiang to head the Zhejiang Cultural 
 Revolution Group. Chen and one of his deputies in the propaganda department, 
 who was also editor-in-chief of the Zhejiang Daily, were paraded in dunces' hats 
 and subjected to a torrent of verbal abused Both the provincial and municipal 
 leaders came under political siege at another large meeting on 17 January** and 
30        CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

the seals of power were seized at the provincial propaganda department, the office 
of the ZPC and at the provincial finance department on 16, 18 and 20 January 

respectively.89 
       United Headquarters convened a further mass rally in Hangzhou on 25 
January at which leaders of the CCP ZPC and HMC such as Wu Xian, Wang Zida 
             and Li Weixin (^£f£fJr), member of the CCP ZPC standing 
committee. Deputy-governor of Zhejiang and recently-deposed Director of the 
provincial Finance and Trade Department, were paraded and denounced for 
approving the issuing of bonuses and funds to "royalist” organizations.9® ZPC 
Secretary Chen Weida, apparently fearing that his turn would come next, fled to 
 the safety of the ZPMD headquarters situated at Qingbo Gate (jf f”J) in the 
 south-west of downtown Hangzhou. Central directives dated 5 October 1966, 16 
 November 1966, and 14 January 1967 had forbidden provincial authorities, under 
 the pretext of transferring confidential documents and files for safe-keeping, from 
 storing "black material" on rebels in military headquarters. An article in Zhejiang 
 Daily, without naming Chen, alleged that he had defied this edict with the 
 knowledge and complicity of the ZPMD leadership.91 
       Once United Headquarters discovered Chen’s presence in the PLA building 
 its members surrounded it, thus provoking a confrontation with the military. On 
 the following day, 26 January, Zhang Xiulong led soldiers of the ZPMD to relieve 
 the siege. The PLA had already received orders signed by Mao that it end its false 
 neutrality in the Cultural Revolution and intervene to support the left. Like its 
 counterparts garrisoned in other provincial capitals, the Zhejiang military 
 leadership was reluctant to support the anarchic behavior of misguided and 
 immature youth, particularly when the rebels' wrath was directed against its 
 colleagues of the provincial party committee. Additionally, children of military 
 cadres were most probably prominent members of the rival mass organization. 
 Red Storm. The account of the incident in the provincial newspaper stated that 
 twenty rebels had sustained injuries, with two being in danger of losing their 
 lives. A joint editorial of Zhejiang Daily and Hangzhou Daily, now under the 
 control of United Headquarters, held Jiang Hua, Long Qian and Zhang Xiulong 
 principally responsible for the melee.92 On 29 January, in response to the bloody 
 confrontation three days earlier. United Headquarters called a rally at which the 
 leaders of the ZPC and the ZPMD came under fierce attack. Further violence 
 ensued.93 Not to be outdone, members of Red Storm attacked the provincial 
 government offices with the objective of seizing party leaders considered 
 unsympathetic to their organization such as Cao Xiangren and Shen Ce, head of 
 the ZPC Organization Department. 
        At this critical juncture the central authorities issued a decision placing 
 responsibility for the 26 January incident firmly on the shoulders of the ZPC and 
                                   OUTBREAK OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION                                   31 

unnamed leaders of the ZPMD.94 The central document demanded that the 
children of high-ranking cadres who had sought refuge in garrison headquarters 
with Chen Weida be handed over to United Headquarters for punishment. It 
ordered leaders of the ZPC and ZPMD to make thorough self-criticisms 
                 before the masses. The ZPMD was again commanded, in the 
spirit of the 23 January order to the PLA to 

       "support the left", to firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary left, 
       firmly support the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries, and 
       firmly support the revolutionary rebels' struggle to seize power so as to 
       facilitate deepening of the class struggle and the all-round unfolding of 
       the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang. 

       The "Decision" requested United Headquarters to leave the ZPMD building 
and to unite with other "proletarian revolutionaries". The central authorities also 
appointed Du Fangping (tiTf1?)' Political Commissar of the Nanjing Military 
Region and later Vice-chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Military Control 
Commission,95 Ruan Xianbang Deputy-commander of the ZPMD 
and Ding Jun (T^J) of the CC s central office to inquire into the affair. It may 
well have been that Du, who was later dismissed for ultra-leftism, and Ding 
 combined to pin the blame on the local military, because Ruan was later accused 
of "opposing the three Reds" and being a "representative of the those who 
 stubbornly adhere to the reactionary bourgeois line".96 The incident sealed Chen 
Weida's fate and undoubtedly destroyed the radical central leaders' remaining 
 confidence in the civilian and military leadership of Zhejiang. 
       The ZPMD's defiance of central directives and support for the ZPC further 
 infuriated United Headquarters. On 27 January Zhejiang Daily and Hangzhou 
 Daily published a joint editorial clamoring for the purging of "capitalist-roaders" 
 from the ranks of the military. Entitled "What are a small handful in the Zhejiang 

 Military District up to?" Qjft ft* 
 ^ ?!) the editorial was accompanied by an item excoriating the local military 
 leaders as "bastards" (jgHiH) and "tools of the bourgeois dictatorship" 97 The 
 ferocity of this language, accompanied by continued rebel attacks on arsenals,95 
 undoubtedly spurred the Hangzhou garrison command into passing a resolution 
 on the same day which backed the rebels.99 Meetings and demonstrations were 
 also held on January 27 to mobilize support for the rebels and opposition to the 

 PLA.100 
        Nevertheless, United Headquarters' principal target remained Jiang Hua. Its 
 campaign to unseat him climaxed in early February 1967. On the 12th of that 
 month. United Headquarters convened a rally at the provincial sports stadium to 
 announce Jiang's dismissal.101 Unbeknown to United Headquarters, however, the 
 previous evening Jiang had departed Hangzhou in a special aircraft despatched by 
32     CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

Zhou Enlai. The decision to rescue Jiang had been taken by Mao.102 The Nanjing 
Military Region command informed Red Storm of the decision on the same 
night, after Jiang's departure.*03 United Headquarters did not discover what had 
transpired until Jiang's absence from the rally alerted them to the fact that 
something was amiss. With the encouragement of the Nanjing Military Region, 
Red Storm broke up the meeting.*0'* And so a prolonged period of bitter 
antagonism between the two major mass organizations was inaugurated. 
     Although Jiang was not the only provincial-level cadre to benefit from Mao's 
intervention, the question of why Mao agreed to protect Jiang requires an answer. 
Several factors seem to have been involved. First, as a national minority cadre, 
Jiang qualified for lenient and privileged treatment. Second, his personal 
connections with Mao dated back to Jinggangshan — cradle of the Chinese 
revolution - the Long March and Yanan, where Jiang had served among Mao's 
security staff. Jiang's wife had once worked as Mao's secretary on Jinggangshan.*05 
Third, Jiang had maintained regular contact with the Chairman after 1949 due to 
 the Mao's preference for Hangzhou as a place to rest and escape the pressures of 
 the national capital. As a southerner Mao presumably preferred the climate, 
landscape and food of Hangzhou. As the hosting provincial leader, Jiang was 
partly responsible for planning inspection tours and making certain that Mao's 
various requirements and comforts were well attended to. Zhejiang's progress in 
 agricultural production, and its regular grain and financial contributions to the 
 center, may well have impressed Mao. 
     After Jiang's arrival in Beijing Tan Zhenlin showed great concern for his 
 fate. On 11 February he met Jiang and told him not to submit a self-examination 
 O&vt)-*06 *n a letter of 17 February 1967 to Lin Biao, written the day after a heated 
 confrontation between members of the Cultural Revolution Group and veteran 
 central officials in Beijing, Tan protested bitterly against the harsh treatment 
 meted out to such local party leaders as Tan Qilong*07 [Shandong] and Jiang Hua. 
 Both men had served under Tan in Zhejiang after 1949. Tan Zhenlin wrote that 
 they had been "struggled against, had worn high hats and been placed in the 
 aeroplane position with their health broken, family scattered and 
 fortune lost (M^^J^)".*08 Then, in a 22 February meeting with a 
 Zhejiang delegation which included representatives of United Headquarters, Tan 
 stated that although Jiang had offended people and everyone wanted to bring him 
 down, this was of no great event. A little explanation would clear things up 

                             !").109 In other words, according to Tan 
 Jiang's mistakes were minor and he should be allowed to survive his ordeal, 
 suitably chastened by the experience. 
      Tan's intervention on behalf of his former subordinate may have reminded 
                              OUTBREAK OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION 33 

the Chairman, who read the letter, of his past associations with Jiang and softened 
his view of the gravity of Jiang’s errors. For whatever reason, the center's 
ambiguous attitude toward criticism of Jiang110 contributed greatly to the 
subsequent upheavals in Zhejiang. United Headquarters was thwarted in its 
efforts to destroy Jiang politically. Red Storm perceived Zhou Enlai's action as 
central endorsement for its backing of Jiang as a member of Mao's "revolutionary 
headquarters". The Cultural Revolution Group clearly favored United 
Headquarters and endorsed its attempts to overthrow Jiang. Yet its backing was 
insufficient to carry the day. Jiang Hua's position remained undetermined while 
the two mass organizations began a lengthy, violent struggle for ascendancy. Long 
after Jiang's departure from the province into temporary political oblivion. 
United Headquarters could cry out in exasperation, "The ghost of Jiang Hua still 
haunts Zhejiang Province" ^ ^ M 0: -S: itUfe 

      The February 1967 confrontation between United Headquarters and Red 
 Storm was the major contributing factor to the bitter enmity which characterized 
 relations between the two organizations from that time onward. Although United 
 Headquarters assumed the mantle of "rebel" organization while Red Storm 
 henceforth bore the opprobrious title "conservative" or "royalist", as Walder has 
 pointed out these names derived from a practical or situational orientation and 
 depended on the specific political situation in each locality.112 One of the major 
 difficulties in assigning labels to the two mass organizations in Zhejiang is the fact 
 that they were both extreme, a point later commented on by Zhou Enlai. The 
 principal source of their differences seemed to hinge on their respective attitudes 
 toward Jiang Hua. This may not have been the origin of mass factionalism in 
 Zhejiang, but it was certainly the major factor behind the tension that continued 
 over the next three years and made the task of administering the province an 
 onerous one. 
       Outside interference did not help matters. Two Qinghua University student 
 emissaries from the Cultural Revolution Group in Beijing, Lin Gang ft) 
 and Han Xiangdong, encouraged the rebels of United Headquarters to persist in 
 their attacks on local leaders despite the protection afforded Jiang Hua at the 
 center. It is probably true to say that if the Cultural Revolution radicals had not 
 coined the tags "proletarian revolutionary" and "conservative" the logic of the 
 situation would have required them to do so. All revolutions require two oppo¬ 
 sing sides -- the revolutionary and the reactionary. In Zhejiang's case, ideological 
 correctness and opportunistic political interests outweighed fidelity to local reality.

           thereafter until his last visit in 1975. He was present in December 1957 when Jiang Hua 
           launched, at the Chairman's behest, his savage attack on the Governor of Zhejiang and 
           other leading officials. In 1963 Mao wrote the important paragraphs published separately 
           as "Where do correct ideas come from?" in Hangzhou and the May 16 circular of 1966 was 
           drawn up at an enlarged meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee in the city. According 
           to a Taiwan report, Jiang Hua attended this meeting. Pacts & Features, 1:13 (April 17,1968),

            expelled 180 personnel from the Public Security Bureau. This incredible charge is repeated 
            without the hair-rising detail in ZJRB, November 15, 1968. In March 1968, at a meeting 
            between central leaders and a delegation from Zhejiang, Jiang Qing made similar 
            allegations against Jiang. At the same meeting Zhou Enlai commented that his 
            correspondence had been opened and referred to evidence about such practices as having been 
            provided by the new leader of Zhejiang, Nan Ping, and by former governor Zhou Jianren. The 
            Premier went on to demand the destruction of the security/judicial apparatus in the 
            province. (SCMP, 4182 May 21,1968), pp. 4-5. These denunciations apparently triggered a 
                                                                                                       NOTES 259

      in June 1968. ZJRB, August 11,1978. He probably died under interrogation designed to force a 
      confession which would implicate Jiang Hua. Jiang's successor as 1st Secretary of the CCP 
      ZPC, Nan Ping, repeated the charges against Jiang at the CCP 5th Zhejiang Provincial 
      Congress held in January 1971. One month later, at a national conference of public security 
      bureaux, Zhou Enlai, in a remarkable volte-face, rebuked all such insinuations against the 
      Zhejiang Public Security Bureau and by implication, Jiang Hua, stating that "we can't say 
      that spies exercised dictatorship over us". To support his position, Zhou quoted Mao as 
      puzzling: "some people say that the Zhejiang public security organs have gone rotten. I've 
      stayed in Hangzhou many times and nothing has happened. How can this be explained?"

      Zhejiang, Shen Ce, a member of the pre-Cultural Revolution CCP ZPC Standing Committee

       trying to frame Jiang Hua for this crime. HZRB, July 26,1978.

        Xiaoxiao, the legendary strongman of the classic novel "Water Margin" Wu Song, and

        Zhejiang provincial committee (probably Jiang Hua) that "there are too many tombs around

          intense political and physical pressure exerted on her by the rebels and committed suicide on 
          January 19,1967. ZJRB, November 6,1978, p. 1. On January 27 a meeting of rebels in Hangzhou 
          debated Wu's "crimes". Lu Jianguang, Director of the provincial Public Security Bureau, 
          attended as a target of criticism and his superior in the public security system, Wang Fang, 
          was described as a "counter-revolutionary revisionist". Cao Xiangren, a member of the CCP 
          ZPC secretariat, delivered a speech in which he supported the call for Wu’s posthumous 
          expulsion from the CCP. ZJRB, January 28,1967, p. 3. A more recent article dates Wu's death

110.    The public naming of leaders in the official press required approval from the center. 
        Approval to name Jiang Hua was not forthcoming until November 1968. In May 1968, at a 
        meeting with United Headquarters' leader Zhang Yongsheng, Jiang Qing asked him, "Since 
        other top capitalist-roaders of the province have been named, why is Jiang Hua not named?" 
         She went on to assert confidently : "What you have to do is just give us a ring". See 
                     (Torch Bulletin), No. 1, July 1968, translated in SCMM, 622 (August 6,1968), 
         p. 10. But clearly it was not that simple. Chen Boda had not hesitated to name Jiang, Li 
         Fengping, Chen Weida and Chen Bing as the leading capitalist-roaders in Zhejiang at a 
         closed-door meeting in Beijing held in March 1968. See SCMP, 4182, p. 12. But Chen, by 
         mentioning Jiang by name, was not conforming with central policy. See ibid, p. 2. Finally, 
         after Jiang was named in the provincial press, his supporters argued that "for Zhejiang 
         Daily to print a person's name means nothing”. ZPS, December 9,1968, 
         SWB/FE/2953/B1/13-15. Jiang was never, so far as I am aware, named in Central Committee 
         documents. Zhao Ziyang's biographer claims that it was significant if a provincial leader, 
         such as Zhao, was not named by the central press when the establishment of the provincial 
         revolutionary committee was announced and that it signified that this particular person s 
         status had not been determined (jojltc/iCtt)- See Zhao Wei, Zhao Ziyang zhuan, p. 170. 
         By this reasoning Jiang Hua's case was in the same category as Zhao's.
