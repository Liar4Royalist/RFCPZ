CONCLUSION 


       The previous pages have described at length the factional politics in Zhejiang 
 during the years 1966-76. It is clear that the rebel leaders of 1966-69 played a major 
role in events in the province from the time of the CCP's 10th National Congress 
 until mid 1975, when the center reimposed order with the ultimate weapon -- 
 military force. This was the first time the PLA had intervened on such a scale in 
 domestic affairs since the Wuhan incident of July 1967. It demonstrated more than 
 anything else the extent to which factionalism had paralyzed and split the 
 provincial leadership and plunged it into crisis. Responsibility for this outcome 
 rested largely on the shoulders of three men, Zhang Yongsheng, Weng Senhe and 
 He Xianchun, whose actions have been detailed above. Supported by Wang 
 Hongwen and other national radicals, but also able to elicit support from factory 
 workers in the main industrial units of Hangzhou in particular, they were able to 
 unleash a range of attacks on the leadership in the province. 
       In 1974 the membership of the "double-criticism small group" was decided 
 upon by Zhang, Weng and He in consultation with their sympathizers on the 
 municipal and provincial party committees. This group then set the agenda, held 
 the meetings and arranged speakers to run the anti-Lin anti-Confucius political 
 campaign in the first half of 1974. Out of the public arena, a lengthy conference 
 involving leading civilian and military bodies, which was directed and 
 manipulated by the same rebels, applied further pressure to the provincial 
 leadership. Additionally, the three rebel leaders attended meetings of the ZPC 
 standing committee as observers, and no doubt their presence worked to unsettle 
 that body's proceedings. Officially-sanctioned bodies such as the militia 
 headquarters terrorized political opponents of the "mountain top" faction and 
 acted as the faction's armed force. The Hangzhou workers' congress convened 
 numerous public meetings and conducted the campaign as if it was independent 
from party control, demonstrating further that control over the political process 
had slipped from the hands of Beijing's authorized representatives in Zhejiang. 
Party branches at both organizations became places where loyalty and activism was 
rewarded by admission to the CCP and appointment to official positions. 
       Yet for all their power and prominence, the rebels' cause was transitory and 
248 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 insecure. Attendance at standing committee meetings was never converted into 
 membership of that body; the small group which conducted the anti-Lm Biao anti- 
 Confucius campaign did not outlive the campaign itself; and in 1975 the center 
 dissolved the mass organizations because of their disruptive role and 
 involvement in factional clashes. Nevertheless, for all the fragility and brevity of 
 their domination of provincial politics, the rebels' challenge in 1973-74 was a 
 qualitatively different kind of rebellion to that which they had mounted in 1967. 
       The problem of succession to the aging leadership of Mao Zedong and Zhou 
 Enlai intensified the instability at the center of Chinese politics and this served to 
 worsen the already volatile situation in Zhejiang. The dramatic events of July 
 1975 occurred just at this juncture. Leaders disposed toward order and reform, 
 such as Zhou and Deng Xiaoping, pushed for measures to increase production, 
 encourage contribution from the educated and trained strata, and liberalize 
 foreign trading contacts. Cultural Revolution radicals, led by the Gang of Four, 
 favored renewed popular mobilization and policies to achieve social 
 egalitarianism. These two fundamentally opposed views of the nature and 
 principal goals of the socialist state proved impossible to reconcile while Mao's 
 role as mediator and arbitrator prevented a decisive victory for either side. 
        In periods when Zhou and Deng gained the upper hand, such as from late 
 1971 until the end of 1972 in the immediate aftermath of Lin Biao's death, and for 
 most of 1975, the success of provincial leadership was judged by criteria which had 
 operated before the Cultural Revolution. These included the local leadership's 
 ability to develop the economy, assure social order and balance central directives 
 with local conditions. When the politics of "continuous revolution" reappeared 
 on the agenda, as in the period from late 1973 until mid 1974, different criteria 
 applied, such as the speed and thoroughness in implementing socio-political 
 campaigns launched from Beijing. The unpredictability and suddenness of such 
 changes in direction often left provincial leaders floundering. They felt uncertain 
 and insecure. Tan Qilong and Tie Ying experienced such an environment between 
 1972 and 1976 and Tie expressed his feelings about this state of affairs in the article 
 which he published in January 1985, describing the vicissitudes of these four years. 
        It was a combination of fortuitous circumstances that enabled the central 
 leadership to act decisively in July 1975 to lance the festering sore in Zhejiang. 
 Deng Xiaoping had gained Mao's confidence and (not wholly unreserved) support 
 to stabilize the country after the upheavals of the anti-Lin anti-Confucius 
 campaign. As part of his strategy, Deng set out to strengthen party leadership in 
 the provinces. Zhejiang was a case where he could demonstrate his skill and 
 resolve. Deng stated in speeches delivered in 1975 that those responsible for 
 factionalism in the localities and the PLA would be dealt with promptly and 
 severely. He obtained Mao's consent to bring in fresh troops to Hangzhou to 
                                                                                CONCLUSION 249 

suppress armed fighting and industrial anarchy among groups of workers in the 
city. 

       While central intervention and the use of military force was an open 
admission that the Zhejiang leadership could not deal with the problem, the 
alternative was the complete breakdown of the provincial administration before 
the forces of confrontation and destabilization. Even Wang Hongwen, who 
seemed to view Weng Senhe as his own disciple, was prepared to compromise to 
prevent such an occurrence. Zhang Yongsheng, Weng Senhe and He Xianchun, 
comparative novices in the Chinese political system, paid the price for not pulling 
back from the brink when warning signs had flashed a bright amber. On the other 
hand, Deng's victory in Hangzhou was not unqualified and it was of short 
duration. 
       Zhejiang's control over its own destiny had slipped from the hands of those 
officials who had been selected to guide it. Beijing alone retained the ability to deal 
with the problems which had accumulated since 1966-67, but only if it possessed 
the common resolve to so act. When central leadership became directionless due 
to tensions and strains at the pinnacle of power, factional tensions in the 
provinces threatened to intensify once again. This phenomenon existed in 
Zhejiang for most of the eighteen months between August 1973 and early 1975. 
Similar forces may well have been at work in other provincial administrations 
during this period but Deng, by making an example of Zhejiang, was choosing a 
province of particular interest to the radical mobilizers based in Shanghai. 
       Two themes raised in this study merit reiteration and elaboration. 

Central-Local Relations 

       Apart from enlarging our knowledge of factional struggle at the provincial 
level in the decade from 1966 to 1976, this study highlights other important 
features of the Chinese political system as it functioned in the Cultural 
Revolution. In the wake of the disintegration of central authority for extended 
periods during the years 1967-68, a debate arose over the nature and extent of the 
decentralization of power to sub-national units. Two divergent views of the 
relationship between central and local power emerged in the early 1970s among 
leading Western observers. 
       Writers such as Parris Chang argued that the center's ability to secure 
compliance from the provinces had been greatly weakened by the turmoil of the 
Cultural Revolution.1 Chang asserted that provincial independence had grown 
considerably, accentuated by the expanded role of the PLA in political life at the 
provincial level. He concluded that the pre-Cultural Revolution command- 
subordinate relationship between center and locality had given way to one 
characterized by negotiation, bargaining and manipulation. While conceding that 
250 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

Beijing retained the ultimate weapon of appointment and dismissal and the 
capability to use force if necessary (as in Wuhan in 1967) Chang was of the opinion 
that such measures entailed a high political cost and were an admission that other 

ways to obtain compliance had failed. 
       Chang's writings, however, did not really explain how the Cultural 
Revolution had brought about such a qualitative change in the nature of these 
 tools of persuasion and coercion, some of which had been previously used 
without the consequences that Chang predicted would eventuate. Nor did he 
convincingly show that the cost to the country of not dealing swiftly with local 
insubordination would far outweigh the dangers involved in a laissez-faire 

attitude. 
       Frederick Teiwes and Victor Falkenheim implicitly and explicitly challenged 
Chang's thesis.2 Falkenheim argued that the system of administrative, fiscal and 
legal powers held by the center remained largely intact despite the ravages of the 
Cultural Revolution. Teiwes noted "sweeping changes" in the relationship 
between center and province, but he concluded, after an exhaustive study of 
 appointments to provincial revolutionary and party committees, that the center 
 was alert to the threat of centrifugal tendencies and was able to curb them by 
 exercising its power of appointment. The provincial leadership, especially its 
 strong military component, had in fact become less local than at any other time 
 since the early post-liberation years. 
       Teiwes discussed in detail the changes which had occurred in this interaction 
 between center and locality. First, he pointed out the increased importance 
 attached to personal ties within the CCP and mass organizations for purposes of 
 protection or benefit in a situation where "the disgrace of powerful figures and 
 erosion of authoritative institutions had become commonplace".3 During the 
 Cultural Revolution, asserted Teiwes, the center of political activity "seemed to 
 shift to the provinces with Beijing frequently playing a mediating rather than a 
 directing role".4 But this did not result in regional fragmentation, he continued, 
 and was partly the result of a conscious decision in Beijing to encourage mass 
 spontaneity and local judgment of the performance of provincial leaders. It was 
 also partly fortuitous due to the disunity among the national leadership, which 
 resulted in an inability to formulate a set of clear-cut policies based on consensus. 
 The vagueness of central directives provided little guidance for provincial officials 
 to deal with concrete policy problems. Additionally, the vertical factional 
 networks (such as that which operated from Wang Hongwen in Beijing down to 
 his followers in Zhejiang) cut across lines of policy communication and obstructed 
 policy implementation. 

       Teiwes asserted, however, that the pre-Cultural Revolution situation in 
 which "provincial politics to a large extent involved balancing local tasks and 
                                                                               CONCLUSION 251 

available resources against central expectations" changed dramatically in the 
period 1967-73.5 The provincial elites faced new and formidable challenges: 

      Mao had created an environment in which skill in adjusting to 
      contradictory signals and shifting power alignments became critical for 
      survival.6 

      In the 1950s and 1960s an overcommitment to a particular set of policies 
could result in disgrace or dismissal once priorities shifted or a mass campaign 
was followed by a period of consolidation. In the Cultural Revolution, a similar 
over-zealousness in pursuing radical policies, or forging too close an association 
with Lin Biao, ended in similar disgrace as the political winds shifted direction. In 
Teiwes' words, in both periods, "circumspection remained an essential political 
tactic". The political history of the Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang, as described 
in the previous chapters of this study, confirms the accuracy of Teiwes' 
generalizations. Tan Qilong survived the years 1973-75, however precariously, 
because his political footwork was more certain than Tie Ying's. In short, he was 
able to work under both Wang Hongwen and Deng Xiaoping. 

Factionalism and Rebellion 

       This book has described and analyzed the changed nature of factionalism and 
factional politics in the 1970s as compared to that characteristic of the early years of 
the Cultural Revolution. Factionalism in the later period became a double-edged 
sword, operating both as an open, mass-based institutionalized phenomenon 
(seen in the operations of such organizations as the Hangzhou Municipal Militia 
Command and the Hangzhou Municipal Workers' Congress with their authority 
to convene mass meetings and organize parades) as well as a clientelist elitist 
secretive process (for example, the existence of an underground command center). 
The combination of the two types of factionalism spelt real danger for the 
Zhejiang provincial leadership, especially in the context of the radicalized political 
environment which emerged after the 10th Party Congress in 1973. 
       Deng Xiaoping identified his opponents by the phrase "bourgeois 
factionalism", but its proponents could draw upon the ultimate source of wisdom 
as political sanction for their activities. The renewed reference in 1973 and 1974 to 
Mao Zedong's belief in the inevitability of factionalism within the party provided 
ideological explanation, if not justification, for the renewed assault on "capitalist- 
roaders" by radical exponents of the politics of the Cultural Revolution. 
       Several western observers have noted the importance of the power struggle 
in the mid 1970s between the veteran cadres and the youthful rebels in 
anticipation of the passing of Mao and Zhou from the political scene.7 Lowell 
Dittmer has described the conflict thus: 
252 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

       The subtle contest between Zhou Enlai and the radicals [1973-75] 
       involved functional rift, policy friction and power cleavage between 
       those chiefly concerned with economic production and those chiefly 
       concerned with mass participation and continued cultural revolution, 
       but the radicals were unable to mobilize sufficient mass support to 
       prevail — partly because of Zhou's own skill at mobilizing support, 
       partly perhaps because the radical constituency had been rusticated and 
       the provincial leadership was well entrenched and capable of denying 
       the licence necessary for radical organization.8 

       In my view, Dittmer has underestimated the organizational achievements of 
the radicals between 1973 and 1976. He has limited the "radical constituency" to 
students, thus ignoring the industrial working class, and exaggerated the extent to 
which the students had been dispersed to the countryside. In Guangdong, there is 
evidence that rustication was a common fate for former Red Guards.9 Figures for 
Zhejiang are difficult to come by and are incomplete. Yet it is clear that many of 
the most influential Red Guard leaders in the province remained politically active 
in the 1970s and obtained positions of some leverage in 1974. Moreover, in 
Zhejiang, Zhang Yongsheng, Weng Senhe and He Xianchun drew on considerable 
mass support from among young and low-paid blue-collar workers who had not 
been rusticated and who were unable or unwilling to settle back to normal 
working life after the upheavals of the years 1966-68. Attachment to Zhang, Weng 
and He's cause may have offered these workers the hope of freeing themselves 
from the grinding routine of factory life and, for the more ambitious among them, 
held out the prospects of rising with their patrons to positions of substance. 
       The Zhejiang provincial leadership in the years 1972-76 was anything but 
"well entrenched", as chapters six through nine in particular have amply 
demonstrated. Tan Qilong was on probation after his downfall in Shandong 
province at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. He was hesitant to call on 
the powers at his command to suppress the rebel cadres, and the fluctuating power 
struggle at the center meant that it was dangerous to throw in one's lot with either 
the veteran cadres or the radicals. The treatment meted out to Tan's deputy Tie 
Ying in 1974 was proof of the risk involved in arousing the animosity of Wang 
Hongwen, who issued directives in the name of the Central Committee and 
Chairman Mao. Zhang Yongsheng was especially conscious of cultivating 
relationships with central patrons by keeping them regularly informed of events 
in Zhejiang. He did not hesitate to utilize his contacts to apply pressure to Tan and 
Tie. That the local radicals did not ultimately prevail was due more to the 
operation of national forces beyond their control than to their own inadequacies. 
       Nevertheless, Dittmer's analysis of the "shallowness" and "narrowness" of 
the Gang of Four's political experience at the central level applied with equal 
validity to their followers in Zhejiang. 10 According to Dittmer, the failure of the 
                                                                                CONCLUSION 253 

endeavor by the radicals to adopt conventional techniques of constituency 
recruitment in major cities caused them, by 1975, to adopt spoilers' tactics. Their 
core following consisted of a collection of young, ambitious yet inexperienced 
cadres who did not hold executive positions. Effective as allies when on the 
offensive against other targets, they lacked the bureaucratic leverage to protect 
their central commanders.11 
       Yet for Wang Hongwen and his radical colleagues in the Politburo, the 
readjustment of Zhejiang's leading group provided them with the opportunity to 
strengthen their influence in a province in which they had taken a close interest. 
Zhejiang, both economically and politically, was an important province in the 
core of Han Chinese power and the support of its leadership could prove valuable 
in a succession crisis in Beijing. Although they were placed on the defensive 
ideologically and politically by the events of 1975, the central radicals were able to 
secure significant gains in the organizational (personnel) field, at least in 
Zhejiang. Deng Xiaoping, perhaps because of his lack of influence in East China, 
was unable to press home his ideological and political victory by appointing a 
leadership group that would fully implement his line and policies. 
       Strangely, given the many descriptions of the organizational weaknesses of 
the Cultural Revolution radicals, it was in the appointments made to the 
reconstituted provincial and municipal power bodies that Deng was forced to 
compromise. Wang Hongwen and Zhang Chunqiao placed several officials 
sympathetic to the radical cause onto the standing committee of the CCP ZPC, 
making Tan Qilong's task to uphold the "correct line of the Central Committee" a 
difficult and problematic one. When Deng’s position weakened at the end of 1975 
and eroded completely in the following year, the weaknesses of the 1975 
compromise were fully revealed. The potential for the pendulum to swing back 
against the leadership of Tan and Tie was soon realized. 
       Anne Fenwick arrived at a more accurate picture of the strength of what she 
termed the "vertical factional network" and the political bases of the radicals.12 
Whilst she recognized that the Gang of Four's faction suffered from the 
weaknesses pointed out by Dittmer, Fenwick acknowledged that 

       The preoccupation of leadership organs at all levels with factional 
       struggles and consequent system-wide immobilism which this 
       spawned between 1971 and 1976 was no mean achievement, especially 
       given the extremely strong elite forces ranged against it.13 

Fenwick, who had visited Hangzhou in early 1976, argued that Weng Senhe, "like 
his elite masters, suffered from inadequate channels of communication and 
organization to shape mass response", and "in his attempt to gain control over 
pre-existing organizational channels, ... met the same decisive opposition as the 
Gang had in its own earlier efforts to co-opt or create new institutions".14 
254 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

      But as Fenwick also pointed out, the faction did not always operate in top- 
down fashion". On occasions the initiative came from below, which in turn 
provided the radicals with political ammunition at the center. The elevation of 
the Zhejiang dispute in late 1974 to one of national dimensions is a case in point. 
The climax of the issue in July 1975 allowed the radicals an input into the 
reorganization of the Zhejiang and Hangzhou party leaderships. Additionally, 

Fenwick argued that 

       For Weng Senhe, ... the mid-1970s really were the continuation of the 
       CR, with political conflict still waged by them through CR methods 
       (socialization of conflict), still structured around CR cleavages (defined 
       in the primarily political terms of rebels versus conservative 
       powerholders, then, as the post-CR power structure was rebuilt, of new 
       versus old cadres), and still dominated by the issue of access to political 
       power.15 

       This viewpoint is partly correct but it overlooks the crucial difference 
between the two periods. The rebel cadres of the 1970s both operated and 
manipulated the system from within, like their more experienced opponents, and 
attacked it from without using the techniques of the 1960s. The combination of 
these two approaches left the provincial leadership in a quandary as how best to 
deal with this threat to their power and privilege. The issues and the methods of 
airing them were similar but the nature of the conflict and the forces involved 
were not merely a replication of the battles of the 1960s. The "mountain top" 
faction of 1973-74 was not United Headquarters reincarnated, just as the 
"mountain base" faction was not merely a recycled version of Red Storm. But 
what dominated the collective consciousness of those who rebelled in 1973 was 
solidarity forged in the battles of the 1960s. Among leading cadres too, common 
interests grounded in the upheavals of 1966-69 continued to dominate their 
consciousness. Lai Keke, for one, argued in his 1976 article that Deng Xiaoping had 
directed his fire at "those revolutionary leading cadres who had united in the 
early stages of the Cultural Revolution" and had later played an active role in the 
campaign of 1974.15 Lai's division of the CCP into the "proletarian revolutionary 
faction" on the one side and revisionists like Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping on 
the other illustrated that for him, as for Chen Boda in 1968, factionalism had 
become an accepted and normal feature of the internal workings of the CCP. In 
 terms of power and elite factional politics, however, the crux of the issue was each 
individual s fate in the Cultural Revolution: whether the person concerned was a 
beneficiary or loser, whether one's career had prospered or foundered. 
       More than twenty years on the Cultural Revolution continues to fascinate 
observers and to cast a long shadow over the Chinese political scene. The recent 
proliferation of Chinese publications on the subject and its leading participants is 
                                                                                CONCLUSION 255 

evidence of this. The Cultural Revolution produced and nurtured a generation of 
politically-aware and battle-hardened young fighters. Their successors have been 
at the forefront of recent demands for democracy and individual rights in China. 
Although their objectives and tactics differ, the re-emergence of street politics may 
help explain the ferocity and barbarity with which the "democracy movement" 
was crushed in the early hours of 4 June 1989, by old men who, remembering the 
 turbulence of 1966-67, resorted to military force rather than face the prospects of 
 renewed turmoil. This may be the lasting legacy of those whom today appear to be 
 the rebel-politicians of yesterday -- activists such as Weng Senhe.
