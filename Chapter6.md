              THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE, 1972-73 


     This chapter discusses the factional politics of the years 1972-73. With the 
removal of Lin's military followers in 1972, a new provincial leadership was 
installed in Zhejiang. Apart from expunging the influence of their predecessors 
the new arrivals implemented a program of economic restoration under the 
direction of Beijing. They also brought back to office prominent former leaders of 
the pre-Cultural Revolution party committee who had languished in political 
limbo for the previous five years. Leading members of United Headquarters came 
under pressure for their past associations with the discredited military leadership. 
Red Storm, by contrast, had relied greatly on its contacts the old provincial civilian 
 and military leaders and with Xu Shiyou in Nanjing. With the return of 
 overthrown cadres in increasing numbers and Xu’s prominent role in purging the 
 influence of Lin Biao in Zhejiang, Red Storm's stocks were set to rise. 
      However, beginning in 1973, disagreements over the pace and extent of the 
 reforms which had been put in place across China threatened the unity of the 
 central leadership. Mao had been badly shaken by Lin’s defection and had allowed 
 Zhou Enlai to introduce policies designed to stimulate the economy and 
 strengthen social and political order. However, he was not prepared to 
 countenance complete rejection of the ideals and political style of the Cultural 
 Revolution. Therefore, in 1973-74 he permitted and encouraged radical central 
 leaders to test anew the commitment of their social base to the objectives and 
 methods of the Cultural Revolution. By so doing the Chairman triggered off a 
 struggle to defend or move away from the politics and policies of the Cultural 
 Revolution. In essence, it was a fight between its political beneficiaries on the one 
 hand and its losers and sufferers on the other. 
       The renewed radical thrust witnessed the reemergence of mass organization 
  leaders who had made their first appearance in the political arena in the turmoil 
  of the mid-1960s. Many activists of the Cultural Revolution had been admitted 
  into the CCP in the intervening years but their career prospects were blocked and 
  threatened by the increasing number of older cadres who returned to their posts 
  after 1972. The desire to uphold and continue the policies and goals of the Cultural 
                               THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE 109 

Revolution thus clashed with the equally determined efforts to modify and 
adulterate them. With central leaders looking for support in provincial 
administrations, increased volatility was introduced into an already unstable 
situation. Zhejiang was one province highly vulnerable to external pressure; 
factional bitterness ran deep and the new leadership had not been given sufficient 
time to consolidate its authority. 
      Beginning in 1973 the pre-Cultural Revolution mass organizations, the 
Women's Federation, trade union councils and the CYL convened provincial 
congresses. Leaders of worker organizations of the Cultural Revolution became 
leaders of trade union councils, while former Red Guards were elected to posts in 
the CYL. Then in 1974, urban militia commands were established in large towns 
and cities under trade union leadership and responsible to municipal party 
 committees, rather than to provincial military districts and their subordinate 
 commands. Rebel leaders in Hangzhou drafted thousands of factory workers into 
 armed contingents in a strategy to build up a powerful strike force capable of 
 taking the offensive onto the streets. These forces also antagonized PL A leaders 
 who resented the militia's independence from its control and its usurpation of 
 public security, patrol and guard duties. 
       After 1968 the mass organizations had been controlled and supervised by the 
 military and their leaders herded into study classes or sent off to the countryside. 
 They were unable to gain positions of power on reconstituted party committees, 
 which soon shunted aside the revolutionary committees where mass 
 organization representation was stronger. In 1974 the mass organization leaders 
 were more successful in obtaining positions in the power structure. Yet in certain 
 respects, power was not saddled with responsibility. The rebel cadres lacked 
 knowledge of or respect for the traditions and formalities associated with the 
 exercise of power. At the same time, their factional organizations continued to 
 operate behind the scenes. The rebel leaders therefore posed a much greater threat 
 to the provincial leadership by their ability both to destabilize it from within and 
 apply pressure from outside the system. With conflicting signals being flashed 
 from Beijing, the Zhejiang provincial party leadership found itself hamstrung in 
 dealing with the rebels. 
       The intensity of the conflict in Zhejiang built up to dangerous levels in 1974. 
 The intrusion of central leaders into the affairs of the province weakened the 
 authority of the local administration. Central factional allegiances became even 
 more entangled in local power plays. Zhejiang was turned into a testing ground 
 for the resolution of disputes which were national in scope but whose specific 
 form was shaped by local events. It was only in 1975 when central leaders 
 temporarily put aside their differences, recognized the danger of continued 
 instability in Zhejiang and acted in concert to check it, that the Zhejiang problem 
110 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

was resolved. But the compromises associated with reaching the solution 
prevented effective implementation of the decision. Later chapters of this study 
will detail the dramatic events of the mid-1970s. 

The New Provincial Leadership 

      After the death of Lin Biao, the central authorities despatched the 
 commander of the Nanjing Military Region, Xu Shiyou, to Hangzhou to take 
 charge of the purge of Lin's followers in the provincial military leadership.1 Xu 
 was responsible for the arrest of Lin’s "sworn followers" in East China2 and he put 
 forward the names of senior cadres to replace Nan Ping and Xiong Yingtang as 
 head of the Zhejiang civilian and military administration. The two replacements 
 were veteran cadre Tan Qilong,3 and Tie Ying,4 then Political Commissar of the 
 strategically important Zhoushan island military base. Tan was not officially 
 appointed First Secretary of the CCP ZPC until April 1973 and Chairman of the 
 ZPRC the following month. Thus, for a period of over one year, Zhejiang was left 
 without a party first secretary and revolutionary committee chairman.5 Neither 
 did the central authorities appoint a new commander of the ZPMD to replace 
 Xiong Yingtang and the post remained vacant until July 1975. Dai Kelin 
             a 3rd Field Army veteran who had been Deputy-commander of the 
 military district since 1966, and who had joined the new order as a member of the 
 standing committees of the ZPRC and the CCP ZPC, may have assumed the title of 
 acting commander in the intervening three years. 
       Tan Qilong had worked as the head of both the Zhejiang and Shandong 
  provincial party committees before the Cultural Revolution. He returned to office 
  in 1969 as Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee before his 
  promotion to Zhejiang. Tan was thus an experienced provincial administrator 
  who had spent five years working in Zhejiang from 1949 to 1954. The central 
  authorities had recognized that Zhejiang required an infusion of personnel who 
  were familiar with its administration and socio-economic situation. Not only had 
  the purged leaders replaced by Tan and Tie been military cadres, they had also 
  been complete outsiders to the province. 
       Tie’s meteoric rise, on the other hand, is not so easily explained. He had no 
  previous experience in non-military posts and his choice for a provincial-level 
  appointment was a surprise. His prior work at various posts in the Nanjing 
  Military Region and his handling of Red Guard activities in the Cultural 
  Revolution (referred to briefly in chapter four) had undoubtedly brought him to 
  Xu Shiyou’s notice. Tie’s first recorded appearance in the Cultural Revolution had 
  been at a February 1969 rally in Hangzhou.6 As late as January 1972 he ranked only 
  6th among PLA leaders from Ningbo and Zhoushan Districts.7 Tie has described 
  how, on one day at the end of March 1972, his secretary relayed an urgent notice 
                               THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE 111 

from the Central Committee summoning him to Beijing. After his arrival in the 
capital by special jet. Tie attended a meeting chaired by Zhou Enlai. He was told 
that he and Tan had been assigned to work in the CCP ZPC with a brief to restore 
production.8 
      On 27 April 1972, Zhou Enlai convened a meeting (perhaps the same one 
referred to by Tie above) to brief Tan, Tie and other leading civilian and military 
cadres from Zhejiang including the Commander of the 5th Air Force, Bai 
Zongshan, about the center's assessment of the state of provincial affairs and to 
assign tasks for the post Lin Biao era.9 Prior to the briefing the Central Committee 
issued document No. 16, dated 25 April 1972,10 announcing the reshuffle of the 
Zhejiang leadership. At the 1972 May Day rally held on 30 April, Tan and Tie 
made their first public appearances in Hangzhou since their appointments. Nan 
 Ping and Xiong Yingtang also attended the rally and were listed first and third in 
 the provincial hierarchy, shadowed by Tan and Tie as second and fourth 
 respectively.11 It was to be Nan and Xiong's last public appearances in Hangzhou. 
 Deputy-secretary of the CCP ZPC, Chai Qikun, a naval commissar, also 
 disappeared from public life from May 1972 until March 1973 in order to undergo 
 investigation for his associations with the Lin Biao group.12 
      The influence of Lin Biao and Cultural Revolution leftism on the 
 administration of Zhejiang certainly extended beyond Chen Liyun, Nan Ping, 
 Xiong Yingtang and Chai Qikun. For the remainder of the year Tan and Tie led a 
 concerted campaign, which had been initiated in Beijing, to criticize revisionism 
 (Lin Biao) and rectify the style of work. Deputy Political Commissar of the ZPMD, 
 Xia Qi, who had been sent to Zhejiang from the Nanjing Military Region in late 
 1970.13 iec} the campaign against leftism in the local military. Xia made speeches 
 on the theme at a provincial militia meeting and at an Army Day reception in 
 1972.14 
       Tan Qilong and Tie Ying not only began the settlement of accounts with Lin 
 Biao's military followers and leftist civilian cadres such as Lai Keke, but they 
 tackled the question of the responsibility of United Headquarters' leaders for 
 violent incidents which had occurred during the mid 1960s. Hua Yinfeng, a 
 member of United Headquarters, was dropped from the ZPC standing committee. 
 Other rebels were forced to confess that they had participated in armed struggle 
 and attacks on military barracks in the years 1967-68. In 1971-72, former advisors to 
 United Headquarters in their capacity as emissaries of the Cultural Revolution 
 Group, Lin Gang and Han Xiangdong, were arrested and kept in supervised 
 confinement. While the arrests had been carried out by the former military 
 leaders, the newly-installed leadership was happy to go ahead with the 
 proceedings against them. Lin was later indicted as a May 16 element .18 
 Simultaneously, and in a move which would further revive old animosities, Qiu 
112 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 Honggen, a leader of Red Storm die-hards was released from prison in January 
 1973. Qiu attributed his release to the "direct concern of the responsible comrades 
 of the ZPC".16 It appeared that the new provincial leadership was showing a 
 partial view toward the disputes of the 1960s. This bias was to prove significant 
 when elite and mass factional struggle resumed at the end of 1973. 
      Sometime between Lin Biao's fatal flight and the reorganization of the 
 provincial leadership, former rebel leaders of United Headquarters and their leftist 
 civilian allies had claimed that they too were "sufferers of Lin Biao's line” and 
 "heroes in opposing Lin Biao". They complained that raising such issues as the 
 January 1967 siege of the military barracks and the August 1967 raids on Xiaoshan 
 and Zhuji (described in chapters one and two) was "counter-revolutionary X7 
 They saw, correctly, that criticism of rebel violence was a prelude to negation of 
 the Cultural Revolution and would result in the abrupt termination of their brief 
 political careers. Understandably, they strongly objected. Nonetheless, there was 
 some truth in the rebels' assertion that they had suffered at the hands of the 
 former military leadership. While some rebel leaders had built up close contacts 
 with the PLA, others including Zhang Yongsheng had developed ties with central 
 and Shanghai civilian radicals such as Zhang Chunqiao, Jiang Qing and Wang 
 Hongwen. After 1969 those in the latter category may have been implicated in the 
 rivalry and antagonism which sprang up between the "pen" and "gun" wings of 
  the central Cultural Revolution establishment. The new provincial leadership 
  would deal harshly with rebels of either category, but on the other hand it granted 
  Red Storm exemption from criticism and more severe forms of punishment. 
       Three former rebel leaders had survived the crackdown of 1969-71 relatively 
  unscathed. Zhang Yongsheng had played a low-key role in provincial politics 
  since the demobilization of the Red Guards and the termination of the Cultural 
  Revolution at the end of 1968. He had emerged from the three years of turmoil as 
  Vice-chairman of the ZPRC, Chairman of the Zhejiang Red Guards Congress, and 
  Chairman of the revolutionary committee at his alma mater, the Zhejiang Fine 
  Arts College. Another leading Cultural Revolution rebel, Weng Senhe, had 
  sometime after 1968 become a standing committee member of the ZPRC, a 
  member of his silk complex party committee when it was reestablished in January 
  1970 and an alternate member of the CCP ZPC at its fifth congress in 1971.18 
  Additionally, Weng was most probably the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial 
  Workers' Congress. Zhang Yongsheng's associate in United Headquarters, He 
  Xianchun, had been a lowly-paid worker at the Hangzhou Heavy Machinery 
  Factory at the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution. He became Chairman of the 
  Hangzhou Revolutionary Workers and Staff Members Committee 
                        which was later renamed the Hangzhou Workers 
  Congress, and was instrumental in the establishment of the municipal social 
                               THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE 113 

order command, whose activities have been referred to in chapter four. He had 
also become Vice-chairman of the Hangzhou revolutionary committee sometime 
before 197119 and in addition was a member of the standing committee of the 
ZPRC and possibly an alternate member of the CCP ZPC. 
     The arrival of Tan and Tie in April 1972 did not bode well for the rebel 
leaders. After the central authorities issued Document 16 in April 1972 Zhang 
found himself in trouble, both politically and physically. He was sent to a study 
class on Moganshan (J| ill) to the north of Hangzhou and was later 
admitted to hospital with an unspecified complaint.20 Weng was detained and 
spent several months laboring in Xiaoshan county. After his return to Hangzhou 
he was kept under surveillance and subjected to criticism at the silk complex.21 
The rebels could little in the circumstances but adopt a contrite demeanor, accept 
the punishment and hope that better times lay ahead.22 
      Both Tan and Tie attended a lengthy report meeting held in Beijing from 24 
May until 25 June 1972 to sum up the progress of the campaign against Lin Biao 23 
Three hundred and twelve participants attended. Mao's 8 July 1966 letter to Jiang 
Qing expressing his reservations about Lin Biao was produced and from 10 to 12 
June, Zhou Enlai, at the Chairman's request, delivered a lengthy report 
concerning the six major line struggles in the CCP before 1949.24 In December 1972 
the CCP ZPC held a work meeting at Mt Pingfeng on the south¬ 
western outskirts of Hangzhou to assess the progress of the campaign 25 Lai Keke, 
who now ranked third in the provincial party hierarchy after Tan and Tie, had 
joined the radical cause in the Cultural Revolution. He was questioned closely 
 about his activities during these years. Lai reportedly admitted that he had 
 committed errors under the influence of Lin Biao's ultra-leftist line and said, at 
 the meeting, "I can never repudiate or reverse the verdict on this" 26 
      The meeting decided to add four new members to the decimated CCP ZPC 
 standing committee. Their appointment had been decided upon by the center in 
 the previous month 1972.27 They included Chen Weida, former Secretary of the 
 pre-Cultural Revolution secretariat, who was appointed Deputy-secretary of the 
 CCP ZPC. Chapter one of this study discussed the January 1967 incident involving 
 Chen, who had disobeyed central instructions and taken party files and documents 
 containing "black material" about rebel leaders to ZPMD headquarters. The 
 resultant confrontation between the military and United Headquarters had 
 contributed to the two-year dispute between the mass organizations in Zhejiang. 
 The other prominent cadre "liberated" at this time was Chen Bing. Chen had been 
 a member of the old CCP ZPC standing committee and Director of the provincial 
 Propaganda Department. In 1966 Jiang Hua had appointed him leader of 
 Zhejiang's Cultural Revolution Group and he had disappeared from the political 
 scene at the end of 1966. He now reemerged as a member of the standing 
114     CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

committee of the CCP ZPC.28 Both Chen Bing and Chen Weida had been Jiang 
Hua's loyal lieutenants and core members of his clique before the Cultural 
Revolution. Two PLA cadres already referred to in the previous chapter, Xia Qi 
and Liu Ang, were also appointed members of the ZPC standing committee. 
     A former deputy of Chen Bing in the propaganda department, Shang Jingcai, 
also resumed work as a leading member of the political work group (i& )□ Zl 
fp£g.)29, the Cultural Revolution replacement for the old provincial 
propaganda and organization departments. Other middle and high-ranking 
bureaucrats returned to their desks under the program of rehabilitation.30 To 
accommodate the large numbers of officials returning to office, the authorities 
decided to restore parts of the pre-Cultural Revolution bureaucratic structure. In 
the Cultural Revolution the bureaucracy had been simplified and departments 
and bureaux amalgamated. In 1973, the Hangzhou authorities moved to replace 
the all-embracing groups (£g.) with the former more specialized and numerous 
systems known as kou (Cl). The reform had the added advantages of providing 
extra places for officials returning to work after an enforced six-year absence and 
placing these more experienced cadres in positions of seniority above their 
younger colleagues who had emerged from the mass movement. It was later 
admitted this consideration was a major factor behind the reform.31 

New Directions, 1972 

      Policy initiatives from Beijing assisted Tan and Tie in their mission of 
restoring social order and normalizing party life. Zhou Enlai, with Mao Zedong's 
approval, assembled a package of policies concerning economic development, 
cadres and intellectuals. The general thrust of Zhou's program was directed 
against the leftism of the Cultural Revolution. In key editorials and articles 
published under his direction or in important unpublished speeches, Zhou 
tentatively suggested a restoration of certain pre-Cultural Revolution policies.32 
In this endeavor Zhou ran into the firm if not unexpected resistance of Zhang 
Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan. Both had acquired substantial formal power in the 
propaganda field as Politburo members and members of the propaganda and 
organization group established in late 1970 (see the previous chapter). Zhou Enlai 
 was senior to both men and was responsible for the routine work of the Central 
 Committee, but on at least four occasions Zhang and Yao, with Jiang Qing's 
 backing, were able to resist or stonewall Zhou's initiatives. 
      The first occasion concerned an investigation report undertaken by Zhou 
 Peiyuan, a noted scientist and head of the administration of Beijing University. In 
 July 1972 Zhou Enlai instructed him to redress the prejudice against basic theory 
 in the physical sciences and to correct leftist policies in scientific research and 
 education.The issue had been raised by a visiting Chinese-American physicist in a 
                                     THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE 115 

meeting with Mao, who turned the question over to the Premier to handle.33 On 
23 July the Premier approved Zhou’s report but People's Daily, which was directly 
under Yao Wenyuan's control, refused to carry the article. Eventually the so-called 
daily newspaper for intellectuals, Guangming Ribao, carried the article on 6 
October 1972. Zhang and Yao then directed the Shanghai daily Wenhui Bao to 
carry articles rebutting the report.34 
       The second occasion Zhang and Yao obstructed the Premier concerned 
Zhou's instructions to People's Daily in August and September 1972 to carry 
articles condemning ultra-leftism.33 Zhou reportedly stated: "Without thoroughly 
discrediting the ultra ’left’ trend, you will not have the courage to implement 
Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line". Eventually, on 14 October, the newspaper 
printed three articles condemning anarchism, a codeword for rebel behavior 
 during the Cultural Revolution. Zhang and Yao directed Wenhui Bao to collect 
 and publish material written by worker groups in Shanghai refuting the Zhou- 
 inspired articles and to send the material to Mao. People's Daily's inhouse 
 publication then republished the articles which contained broadsides against 
 "revisionism and a rightist counter-current".36 
       Next, Zhou's attempt to insert direct criticism of ultra-leftism into the 1972 
 national day joint editorial of People's Daily, Liberation Army Daily and Red Flag 
 was thwarted by Yao Wenyuan, who twice deleted the offending passage and 
 limited mention of the harmful effects of ultra-leftism to specific policy areas.37 
 The final occasion arose when the CCP CC International Liaison Department and 
 the Department of Foreign Affairs submitted a joint work report in late 
 November 1972, attacking the influence of ultra-leftism and anarchism in the 
 conduct of foreign relations, Zhang Chunqiao and Jiang Qing rejected the report 

 after it had received Zhou Enlai’s approval 38 
        Matters came to a head in December 1972 when senior personnel of People's 
 Daily, undoubtedly confused by countermanding orders from above, wrote to Mao 
 expressing agreement with Zhou Enlai's opinions concerning ultra-leftism. On 17 
 December Mao called in his confidants on theoretical issues, Zhang Chunqiao and 
 Yao Wenyuan, to discuss the matter. Perceiving that the logical outcome of 
 Zhou's push against ultra-leftism and the association between ultra-leftism and 
 Lin Biao would reflect badly on the Cultural Revolution, Mao moved to stem the 
 tide. He reversed the judgment that he had held about Lin as late as June 197239 
 and now categorized Lin as an "ultra-rightist, revisionist, splitter, schemer and 
 intriguer, and traitor to the Party and the country".411 For their action in siding 
 with the Premier, Wang Ruoshui and other leading members of People s Daily s 
 editorial department including Hu Jiwei, were called to the Great Hall of the 
 People and accused by Jiang Qing of "splitting the center" and by Zhang Chunqiao 

 of being "ultra-rightists".41 
116 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

      In terms of policy reform, agricultural distribution was one of the principal 
areas in which Zhou and his subordinates attempted to reverse what they 
considered to be extreme examples of radical social and economic policies. 
Egalitarianism and political assessment of work performance were rejected and 
moves initiated to revert to "distribution according to work".42 In January 1972 
Zhejiang Daily had published a commentary endorsing the position.43 The 
restoration of "rational rules and regulations" in running industrial enterprises 
was also announced, and tentative steps were initiated to put education policy 

back on a more formal footing 44 
       Mao's intervention did not signal an immediate end to all the policies that 
the Premier was in the middle of implementing. For one thing, many of Zhou's 
policies had built up a momentum of their own. In addition, while demanding 
strict conformity to vague ideological prescriptions concerning class struggle and 
other theoretical issues, the Chairman permitted his lieutenants greater freedom 
of movement in policy areas in the final years of his life. Mao s switches in 
direction, however, were unnerving for those working under him. Policies 
relating to the rehabilitation of veteran cadres and economic adjustment 
 continued to be implemented. After listening to a report on planning and the 
 strengthening of economic management on 16 February 1973, the Premier directed 
 that bonuses and piece-work rates, largely abandoned in the Cultural Revolution, 
be reintroduced for jobs involving heavy physical labour. Zhou also suggested a 
 more sweeping rectification of the national economy.45 
       In August 1972 Chen Yun and Wang Zhen were among the first central 
 leading cadres rehabilitated after the Lin Biao affair 46 In May 1973, the arch¬ 
 criminal of the "February Countercurrent", Tan Zhenlin, and twelve other 
 veteran cadres, including such prominent provincial figure as Li Jingquan 
 (Sichuan), Li Baohua (Anhui), Jiang Weiqing (Jiangsu) and Jiang Hua (Zhejiang), 
 were permitted to resume work 47 In March 1973 the "No. 2 capitalist-roader" 
 Deng Xiaoping had returned to office as Vice-premier of the State Council and at 
 the CCP's 10th National Congress in August Deng was elected to the Central 
 Committee. 

 Leftist Revival, 1973 

        Despite the Premier’s persistence in continuing with his policies of 
 restoration, Mao's definition of Lin Biao as an "ultra-rightist" spelt danger for 
 him. Bolstered by the Chairman's reaffirmation of the Cultural Revolution, its 
 principal remaining beneficiaries in the central leadership, Jiang Qing, Zhang 
 Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan and Wang Hongwen devoted their energies to 
 propagating its virtues. In September 1972 the youthful Wang had been 
 transferred to the national political arena48 and then in May 1973 co-opted onto 
                                    THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE                                117 

the Politburo. The work meeting of the CCP CC, held from May 20 to 31,1973, 
decided to invite Wang, Hua Guofeng and Beijing party First Secretary Wu De to 
sit in on Politburo meetings and participate in the body’s work. The step was taken 
because of the loss of one third (seven) of the Politburo's membership as a 
consequence of the Lin Biao affair.49 In order to reward their followers and at the 
same time strengthen their organizational base the four radicals, later described by 
Mao as the Gang of Four, took advantage of the opportunity presented by the re¬ 
establishment of pre-Cultural Revolution mass organizations to push for the 
election of Cultural Revolution activists to leading positions. Additionally, they 
intervened in the selection of delegates to the 10th Party Congress to press the 
claims of their followers. 
       Articles in the national press renewed the attack on revisionism, highlighted 
the achievements of "new bom things", praised Jiang Qing's contribution to the 
revolutionization of the arts and promoted the exploits of model rebels who dared 
to "go against the tide".50 One such model was Zhu Kejia, a Shanghai youth who 
had settled down in Yunnan Province rather than take advantage of the 
opportunity to return to his hometown. Another was Zhang Tiesheng, a 
rusticated youth from Liaoning. In 1973 Zhang sat for the university entrance 
examinations, the first such examinations held since 1966. His paper was blank 
except for comments protesting against the system's discrimination against sent- 
 down-youth such as himself. A third was Huang Shuai, a primary school student 
 from Beijing municipality who protested against ill-treatment at the hands of her 
 teacher and wrote to the city newspaper about her case. All of the examples 
 received prominent media attention and rebels such as Zhang Tiesheng were 
 selected as delegates to the 10th Congress. Another person whose cause was taken 
 up by the central radicals was Hangzhou's Weng Senhe (see chapter seven).51 
       In May 1973, in a development that would have important repercussions for 
 the future, Mao raised the question of publishing a critique of Confucius.52 The 
 historical role of the sage and his evaluation by communist historians had long 
 been a matter of intense debate. On several occasions, Mao himself had previously 
 expressed an ambivalent attitude toward Confucius. In the early 1970s official 
 publications had sporadically carried articles critical of China's most influential 
 philosopher and teacher.53 On 1 December 1972 a professor of philosophy from 
 Guangzhou's Zhongshan University, Yang Rongguo, had published an article in 
 Hongqi concerning class struggle in the period of the warring states in which he 
 harshly criticized the sage’s historical role.54 On 7 August 1973, Yang's 
 reassessment of Confucius, examined and approved by Mao,55 was published. 
        In a talk with Zhang Chunqiao and Wang Hongwen on 4 July 1973 Mao 
 again criticized the historical role of Confucius and went on to make the 
 astounding assertion that Lin Biao, in relation to his alleged veneration for 
118 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 Confucius and opposition to Legalism, held the same outlook as the KMT.56 jiang 
 Qing reportedly attempted to include the gist of Mao's comments into the political 
 report presented to the 10th National Congress, but was thwarted by Zhou Enlai 57 
 Shortly after the Congress, at a meeting with the Vice-president of Egypt, the 
 Chairman praised the unifier of China Qinshihuang, and criticized Confucius, 
 thus stimulating the historiographical debate over the relative merits of the 
 Legalists and the Confucianists (J^^^)-58 It was thus Mao who 
 applied the theme of historical and class retrogression to link Lin and Confucius. 
 By this device Mao, in the opinion of one observer, sought historical justification 
 and legitimacy for the Cultural Revolution. To the Chairman, Legalism 
 represented rebellion while Confucianism was equated with revisionism.59 
        Mao took a further step to shift his support from Zhou Enlai. In April 1973, 
 in a talk with Zhang Chunqiao and Wang Hongwen, the Chairman censured 
 Zhou for his management of foreign affairs. His four sentence conclusion read: 
 major issues are not discussed and only minor issues are submitted; if this 
 method is not changed it will lead to revisionism 
 ^ ^ JkMM)-60 Mao’s reference to minor 
 issues may have concerned Zhou's 8 March apology to foreign experts who had 
 been treated discourteously or victimized during the Cultural Revolution.6! The 
 Politburo meeting in November discussed Zhou's transgression and other blunt 
  criticisms of the Premier raised by the Chairman and Jiang Qing announced that 
  the party’s 11th line struggle had commenced. She also accused Zhou of being too 
  impatient to wait a reference to his zeal in moving to rescind 
  the politics and policies of the Cultural Revolution. Mao in turn rebuked Jiang for 
  the extravagance of her comment.62 With these cryptic comments to an inner 
  circle of courtiers and by expressing his displeasure at Zhou's handling of the 
  affairs of state, Mao was inviting a return to the mobilizational politics of the mid 
  1960s. He was signalling in no uncertain terms that the retreat from the Cultural 
  Revolution had ended. It was time to go on the offensive. 

  Impact in Zhejiang 

        To assess his leadership capabilities, the central authorities despatched Wang 
  Hongwen on a provincial familiarization and inspection tour at the end of 1972. 
  On 18 December 1972 Wang visited a cotton mill in Xinjiang and reportedly said 
  to a delegation of worker representatives that "if I was a worker I wouldn't go to 
  work because that's restoring capitalism!”63 The following month he journeyed to 
  Zhejiang. Wang's visit to Hangzhou in January 1973 paved the way for the 
  resurgence of the Cultural Revolution radicals in Zhejiang.64 Included in Wang's 
  brief was the difficult task of explaining to provincial leaders such as Tan Qilong 
  and Tie Ying Mao's sudden change of mind regarding the nature of Lin Biao's 
                                     THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE 119 

political errors. In speeches he delivered at factories such as the Hangzhou silk 
complex and other units in Hangzhou and Jiaxing65 -- a city midway between 
Shanghai and Hangzhou — Wang questioned the correctness of the campaign of 
 the previous year against Lin Biao. 
       Wang reportedly claimed that the movement in Zhejiang had gone too far 
 ("^T T had suppressed a faction and become "entangled in old 
 historical scores". He announced that he had come to "pour some cold water on 
 this". Wang met Weng Senhe twice on his visits to the silk complex and allegedly 
 encouraged him to prepare for further battles.66 Wang and Weng had shared 
 somewhat similar personal histories in the Cultural Revolution. Both men had 
 rebelled early against the party leaderships of their textile mills and both had 
 played major roles in the leadership of workers’ organizations in their respective 
 cities. By 1973 Wang had achieved high political office and undoubtedly was an 
 inspiration to Weng. At his meeting with Weng, Wang urged him to "strike back 
 and rely on yourself in the struggle" U Hi-5}')-67 
        Wang's declaration that the rebels must gain positions of power would have 
 struck a chord with Weng and his associates. Weng later wrote of his admiration 
 for the power Wang had obtained in Shanghai and said that he "took his hat off " 
                            to him and wished to emulate him.68 With 
 Wang's arrival the opportune moment seemed to have arrived. In February, after 
 Wang's departure, the significance of the visit as well as the prospects it opened 
 up was discussed in meetings held at a rebel’s home. One of Weng's colleagues, 
 who was present at the meetings, recalled later that Weng had described Wang 
  Hongwen's visit as a signal for the rebels to reenter the political fray.69 
        The upshot of Wang's visit, apart from the devastating impact it was to have 
  on provincial politics, was a gradual redirection of propaganda in line with Mao's 
  wishes. On occasions, however, the propaganda appeared highly unconvincing, 
  perhaps reflecting both the confusion in the minds of local officials and their 
  reluctance to fall into line. A commentary in Zhejiang Daily of January 1973 stated 
  that "swindlers like Liu Shaoqi" sometimes appeared leftist in their actions but 
  actually they were extreme-right.70 However the examples given to substantiate 
  the argument were clearly all policy deviations to the left. The PLA in Zhejiang 
  seemed equally confused or unwilling to go along.71 The abruptness of the 180 
  degree turn necessitated the despatch of large numbers of cadres to the grassroots 
  to clarify the position with local officials.72 No doubt they were bemused to learn 
  that Lin Biao had opposed the Cultural Revolution. Even as late as August 1973, 
  on the eve of the 10th Congress of the CCP, it was admitted that some people still 
  did not understand the substantive reasons behind the campaign against Lin 73 
  They were not helped by the blatant disjuncture between radical rhetoric and 

  moderate policy which prevailed in 1973. 
120 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

The Reconstitution of Mass Organizations, 1973 

       Before the convention of the 10th National Congress, provincial party 
committees were instructed to reconstitute pre-Cultural Revolution mass 
organizations which had become defunct in 1967. To some extent, workers 
congresses and Red Guard congresses had filled the roles formerly played by trade 
unions and the CYL. However, membership of the workers congresses was 
generally restricted to Cultural Revolution rebels and activists who tended to be 
younger and less career oriented. Veteran workers had thus lost a body to 
represent their interests, however inadequately. Similarly Red Guard congresses 
attracted a certain type of political activist and did not cater so well for youth 
whose interests were of a less politically centered kind. Another not unimportant 
consideration was that the reconstitution of the mass organizations would further 
 signal the return to political normality. 
       It will be recalled that the central propaganda and organization group 
 established under the Politburo in late 1970 had been charged with responsibility 
 for overseeing the work of mass organizations. In April 1970 reference had been 
 made to a county Youth League branch in Heilongjiang province followed, in 
 February 1971, by mention of a Trade Union Council.74 The People's Daily New 
 Year's day editorial for 1973 highlighted reconstruction of the mass organizations 
 as one of the principal tasks for the coming year.75 In Zhejiang, two reports of 1971 
 and 1972 mentioned party activity among youth.76 
       Of the three mass organizations it was the struggle for control of the Trade 
 Union Council which galvanized the contending parties in Zhejiang into action. 
 In April 1973 the Central Committee had issued directives to "rectify and cleanse" 
 workers' congresses as a prelude to the re-establishment of trade union councils. 
 A People's Daily editorial outlined the tasks for trade unions after the convocation 
 of congresses in Beijing and Shanghai.77 Criticism of revisionism (Lin) and 
 rectification of work style was given top priority. The crucial, unsettled question 
 was whether Lin was criticized as an ultra-leftist saboteur, responsible for the 
 anarchy and disruption of the Cultural Revolution, or whether he was lambasted 
 as an ultra-right revisionist who had wrecked an otherwise glorious revolution. 
 Clearly, the CCP was divided on the issue and the editorial reflected the cleavage. 
 Unity among the working class was advocated, but it was a militant unity. 
 Professional knowledge was required but it was to be guided by proletarian 
 politics. The editorial called on workers to increase labor productivity and fulfil 
 state plans while at the same time urging them to participate in management. The 
 equivocal tone of the editorial suggested that the writers were undecided where 
 priorities lay and in order to appease both the "reds" and the "experts" they were 
 being eclectic in their recommendations. 
        In Zhejiang, Weng Senhe and He Xianchun, who were influential figures in 
                                     THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE 121 

the provincial and municipal workers' congresses Clift z*) wished to model 
the restructured trade union councils (X^) on existing bodies. They proposed 
the purely formal measure of removing the character dai (-ft) from the 
organizations under their control, otherwise leaving their organizations and 
leaderships intact. Weng and He boycotted meetings of the preparatory group 
appointed by the ZPC to convene the provincial trade union congress because 
according to Weng, "at the moment we certainly can't get much out of it" (jfj 
X SI ft* )• At the Hangzhou Cable Factory He Xianchun tried to implement 
the window-dressing changes that he and Weng favored, only to succeed in 
causing division among the workers present at the meeting.78 
       Weng and He may have delayed the convocation of the trade union congress 
by their tactics of non-cooperation but they could not prevent its eventual 
opening. In late April 1973 the ZPC convened a forum of the preparatory group79 
at which veteran union leaders reportedly criticized Weng and He’s factional 
schemes.80 Three months later, in July 1973, 1,600 delegates and 100 invited 
representatives filed into the opening session of the 6th provincial congress of the 
ZPTUC. The delegates had been selected from four specific groups; activists of the 
Cultural Revolution and the "criticize revisionism and rectify the style of work" 
 campaign, model workers, advanced producers and members of Mao Zedong 
 Thought propaganda teams. Thirty percent of the delegates were female, 25% were 
 classified as young workers and 70% of the delegates came from the industrial 
 work force. If delegates from the four categories received equal representation at 
 the congress. Cultural Revolution activists would probably not have gained a 

 majority. 
       In his opening speech to the Congressman Qilong emphasized the 
 importance of unity among the working class.81 But this appeared to be a unity, as 
 Tie Ying stressed in his closing address, based on a clear recognition of right and 

 wrong. Tie stated provocatively that 

       We must strive to unite not only with comrades who share our views 
       but also with those who hold different views.We must also work on 
        uniting with those who formerly opposed us and have since been 
        proved wrong.82 

 The reference to those who "have since been proved wrong", was clearly directed 
 toward Zhang, Weng, He and the old United Headquarters organization. The 
 verdict on the events of 1967-69 had been reversed in favour of Red Storm. 
 However, Tie's reminder of past divisions among the working class of Zhejiang 
 was not conducive to overcoming factionalism and seemed to conflict with Tan s 

 earlier unqualified appeal for unity. 
       The lack of unity at the congress was accentuated by the fact that it was the 
 naval cadre Chai Qikun, and not a trade union leader, who delivered the mam 
122       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

report. In it Chai mentioned that since the Cultural Revolution a large number of 
advanced workers had been admitted into the CCP,83 and that many had been 
promoted to leading positions at various levels.84 However, the real test of the 
 rebels' power came in the election of the provincial trade union leadership. The 
 delegates elected a 120-strong committee (of which 30% were women) which chose 
 a 27 member standing committee. This body in turn nominated an executive 
 consisting of nine members — a Chairwoman and eight Vice-chairmen. 
       Jiang Baodi was elected Chairwoman of the ZPTUC. Jiang was known as 
 Hangzhou's Wu Guixian after the female textile worker from Xian, who as a 
 result of the Cultural Revolution, rocketed to prominence, becoming an alternate 
 member of the Politburo of the CCP 10th CC and later Vice-Premier of the State 
 Council. Like Wu, Jiang was also a textile worker. She had belonged to the United 
 Headquarters faction but represented it more in a figurehead capacity. Jiang was no 
 rebel in the Weng Senhe mould. She was also a standing committee member of 
 both the CCP ZPC and ZPRC and an alternate member of the CCP 9th and later the 

 10 th CC. 
        The two senior Vice-chairmen were veteran trade union officials, Xu 
 Wanzhen and Chen Yousheng. Xu was the party secretary of the Zhejiang Hemp 
 Mill, widow of ZPC propaganda department head Jin Tao who had died in 1966, 
 and sister-in-law of Chen Weida (whose wife, Xu Wenhua, was at that time party 
 secretary of the Foreign Languages Department of Hangzhou University). Xu 
 Wanzhen had been Vice-chairman of the pre-Cultural Revolution ZPTUC as well 
 as executive member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.815 Chen 
 Yousheng was a boiler expert who had been selected as a model worker in the 
 Great Leap Forward. He had been a delegate to the 2nd and 3rd NPC. Another 
 veteran model worker who was elected Vice-chairman was "Red diving engineer" 
 Yao Xingen, like Chen a person whose fame was a product of the Great Leap 
  Forward.86 A long-serving trade union bureaucrat, Zhao Jingtang, was also elected 
  Vice-chairman. 
        The remaining four Vice-chairmen were all Cultural Revolution rebel 
  leaders. Fang Jianwen, who, in 1969 had been singled out for attack in a Central 
  Committee document (see chapter four), was one of the four Vice-Chairmen. He 
  was the leader of that faction within Red Storm which had refused to accept the 
  terms of the May 1969 agreement with United Headquarters. Four years later 
  Fang's obduracy had paid dividends and it is possible that Tie Ying had pressed for 
  his inclusion in the leadership. Another worker rebel leader who joined the 
  executive was Guo Zhisong. He was known as "Guo the lame" after a violent 
  incident in which he had been severely beaten. In the 1960s Guo had been a leader 
  of United Headquarters but later fell out with the organization. He was to play a 
  notable but publicly unheralded role in the factional disturbances of 1973-74. 
                                     THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE 123 

Weng Senhe and He Xianchun were also elected Vice-chairmen of the ZPTUC. 
       The election of the four rebel leaders illustrated the strength of their factional 
support in the province, and their claim for recognition was one that the party 
leadership could ignore only at its peril. If, as local propaganda reports later 
 claimed, Weng and He used their positions as Vice-chairmen of the ZPTUC as a 
 springboard to launch their assault on the provincial authorities, it was not due to 
 their numerical strength on its executive.87 Through superior tactics, force of 
 personality and an ability to mobilize their supporters, they may have 
 outmaneuvered their opponents. But they controlled another organization which 
 played a greater role in the political struggle of 1974. This was the Hangzhou 
 workers' congress led by He Xianchun. He and his followers successfully resisted 
 all efforts to disband the organization and it continued to function as an officially- 
 recognized body and one which would prove a thorn in the side of the provincial 

 leadership.88

        In addition to being one of the first provincial-level administrations to hold 
 a trade union congress, Shanghai also led the way in the re-establishment of the 
 Communist Youth League. After the convocation of its municipal congress in 
 February 1973 a People's Daily editorial of 22 February set out the tasks of the 
 organization.89 A balance between Cultural Revolution rhetoric and a more 
  traditional view of the League's tasks seemed evident in this editorial. Yet on 
 balance the editorial emphasized more the concerns of the central radical 

  propagandists. 
        The CYL congresses of Hangzhou and Zhejiang convened in April and May 
  1973. They also became battlegrounds for contention between Red Guard leaders of 
  the former United Headquarters and Red Storm mass organizations. A report of 
124       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

February 1973 specified the categories from which delegates would be selected for 
the forthcoming congresses.90 These included a certain percentage of female 
representatives, little red soldiers, national minorities (a category of little 
relevance in Zhejiang) and qualified sons and daughters of ' dubious elements , 
(youth of less reliable class background) who could be re-educated. The report 
added that members of leading groups should be carefully screened and selected 
after repeated consultation. They should have made significant contributions 
since the Cultural Revolution in the economic, cultural or military fields and 
most would remain in their units after election to positions of responsibility. A 
certain percentage of the new leadership should have had previous experience in 
CYL work, stated the report, but its average age would be low with a fixed number 

of females gaining leadership posts. 
       From 10 to 14 March the CCP ZPC held a preparatory meeting to make 
 concrete arrangements for the congresses.91 Tie Ying addressed the sixty people 
 present and stressed the bond between the League and the CCP. He almost 
 certainly raised the issue of unity, as an editorial of Zhejiang Daily, published on 
 the same day, stated unambiguously: 

       We must take into consideration the situation as a whole and 
       overcome bourgeois factionalism while upholding the Party spirit of 
       the proletariat. 

 The editorial enjoined the delegates, in words taken directly from Mao's 1964 five 
 requirements for successors to the revolution, to strive for unity whether their 
 fellow-delegates shared their views or not, and even with those who "formerly 
 opposed us and have since been proved wrong in practice" (TfC (B § gj 
 ft g g ESJaL 
 TOW g H# A&te 
                     7 4frnA)-92 Tie Ying later used similar 
 words in his closing address to the Trade Union Congress. The editorial and Tie's 
 remarks were strong indictment of United Headquarters. By July, when similar 
 words were expressed at the Trade Union Congress, the rhetoric had moderated, 
 an indication that the revived strength of "leftist" forces at the center was making 
 an impact in Zhejiang. 
        The 5th provincial congress of the CYL opened on 16 May 1973 and closed 
 one week later.93 One thousand four hundred and thirty-two delegates, 44% of 
 whom were women, as well as Red Guard observers attended the opening 
 ceremony. Tan Qilong delivered the opening address in which he asked his 
 listeners to adhere to the general orientation of the 1972 campaign against 
 revisionism. Wu Peisheng, who was elected the first of four secretaries, made a 
 report entitled "Strive to train the younger generation into successors to the 
 revolutionary cause of the proletariat". The Congress elected a committee of 103 
                                     THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE 125 

members and 15 alternate members whose average age was 23.2 years. It in turn 
chose a standing committee of 15. Its executive of four secretaries and four deputy- 
secretaries included two women.94 
       Little is known of the backgrounds of the members of this executive. 
Secretary Wu Peisheng was Vice-chairman of the Jiangshan county cement works 
revolutionary committee in southern Zhejiang and a member of the ZPC. His 
factory had received a certain amount of publicity since 1970, particularly for its 
study of Marxist philosophy (see chapter five).95 Another secretary, Zhang 
Jinguang, was a "veteran" CYL cadre, having been a member of the 9th national 
CYL CC before the Cultural Revolution.96 Two Deputy-secretaries, Teng Zhu and 
Liu Ying, were former leaders of Red Storm from Zhejiang University. The only 
executive member known to have been an activist in United Headquarters was 
Deputy-secretary Wang Zexin. He was a graduate of the politics department of 
Hangzhou University and had been a delegate to the CCP's 9th national congress. 
       The party leadership in some provinces appointed a prominent party or 
government official to head the local CYL body, presumably to ensure tight 
control over the organization. For example, Xie Jingyi, daughter of the late Xie 
Fuzhi and a confidential secretary to the CC General Office, became CYL secretary 
in Beijing.97 Xie was also a standing committee member of the CCP Beijing 
Municipal Committee and in August 1973 was elected a member of the CCP 10th 
CC. Other provincial CYL secretaries, including Zhejiang's Wu Peisheng, were 
members of provincial-level party committees or were elected to the CCP 10th CC 
in August 197398 The Zhejiang Provincial Red Guards Congress was not 
 dissolved. In May 1974 it published an article in Zhejiang Daily commemorating 
 the 55th anniversary of the May 4th movement.99

       The third mass organization to be reconstituted was the Women’s 
126 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

Federation. After district branches held congresses, in many cases the first they had 
ever convened,*™ the provincial meeting took place from 12 to 17 August 1973, 
on the eve of the CCP 10th Congress. Over 1,000 delegates attended and accordmg 
to the reports, most were of peasant and worker origin. After listening to speeches 
and reports by Tan Qilong, Chai Qikun, Tie Ying and Chen Bing (all men!) the 
women elected a committee of 120 which selected twenty-one women to form the 
 standing committee. The executive consisted of a Chairwoman and seven Vice¬ 
 chairwomen.101 Vice-chairwoman of the ZPRC and a former member of the CCP 
 ZPC standing committee, Hua Yinfeng was elected Chairwoman. Although she 
 had previously belonged to United Headquarters, like Jiang Baodi she had 
 probably not been an influential or active member of that organization and 
 certainly presented no threat to the provincial party leadership. Of the known 
 backgrounds of the seven Vice-chairwoman one, Shao Suzhen, had been a 
 member of United Headquarters and another, Lu Su was a veteran cadre in the 
 women's movement.1® Liu Tianxiang was an activist in a democratic party 

 within the United Front.

        There is no evidence that the Zhejiang Poor and Lower-middle Peasants' 
 Association convened a congress in this period. Hunan province held a provincial 
 congress of the organization between November and December 1973.103 Party 
  secretary of Hangzhou's Red May brigade of the East Wind People's Commune, 
  Mo Xianyao (HH jljg), who was a member of both the CCP 9th and 10th CC, 
  was later identified as Chairman of the association.104 

  Two Lines in Contention 

        Reports from Zhejiang about the mass organization congresses and other 
  articles published prior to the 10th Congress devoted considerable space to 
                                     THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE 127 

defending the achievements of the Cultural Revolution. Reference was made to 
the induction into the CCP of young people and under-represented groups such as 
women and their promotion to positions of authority. For example one report 
declared that "in recent years" 470,000 young people had joined the CYL and 28,000 
CYL members had been admitted into the CCP. Tan Qilong mentioned in his 
speech to the Women’s Federation Congress that 100,000 women had joined the 
 CYL since the Cultural Revolution, 10,000 had entered the CCP (these round 
 figures were later revised to 140,000 and 12,000 respectively) and 5,000 female 
 cadres had been promoted to positions of leadership at and above the commune 
 level. Of the 330,000 young people who had been sent from cities to either border 
 regions, to the countryside of Zhejiang, or to the outskirts of Hangzhou, 19,580 
 from Hangzhou had joined the CYL, 770 the CCP and 8,000 were working in 
 leadership positions.105 Other media reports praised policy achievements in the 
 fields of rural health and education. New procedures for admission to tertiary 
 institutions and problems associated with the rustication of educated youth were 
 discussed. The general thrust of the policies was affirmed. The perennial issue of 
 cadre participation in manual labour also received attention. 
        However, other articles in the provincial press extolled the achievements of 
 the 1972-73 campaign against revisionism (Lin Biao) and detailed the successful 
 implementation of pragmatic economic policies. A striking example was the 
 achievements of the Hangzhou Iron and Steel Works. In 1968 a work team from 
 Chen Liyun's Unit 7350 had entered the factory to take over the management.106 
 The air force personnel found that they lacked the expertise to run it properly and 
 the mill may well have been one of the factories described in colorful terms by Tie 
 Ying, after his transfer to Hangzhou in 1972, as a place where production had 
 ceased, machinery had rusted up and the surroundings were overgrown with 

 weeds.107 
        By the autumn of 1972 production at the mill had recovered sufficiently for it 
 to send exhibits to the Guangzhou Trade Fair.105 A Xinhua report of June 1973 
 attributed the production increases which had occurred in the first half of the year 
 to sustained efforts by the leadership to overcome splits and factionalism among 
 the workers.109 The article attacked "swindlers like Liu Shaoqi" (Lin Biao) for 
 trying to divide the workers. It also made scathing references to "class enemies" 
 who schemed to "redefine classes" (SSJr#J#M’&) and who stated 
 privately that "if they unite we've had it ('ftJifni[j£'Ej'3tS5|£>$CinsdC^ 
  flj^f). This comment revealed the tenuous nature of the solidarity among 
  the workers in the mill. It was also an indication that for some activists of the

       One acute observer of Chinese politics has noted, in relation to the existence 
 side by side of two lines in the media, that "There seems to have been an 
 understanding at the center that both sides in the ’debate' pursued from 1973 to 
                                     THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN RULE                               129 

1976 should have equal access to the media".111 The publication of articles in 
Zhejiang and elsewhere emphasizing class struggle and the achievements of the 
Cultural Revolution on the one hand, and those devoted to less dramatic topics 
such as economic development on the other, reflected the equilibrium in the 
national leadership between the forces of order and those favouring mobilization. 
Both sides were testing the waters for a confrontation, but while Mao maintained 
a neutral stance neither could move until it was certain that it had obtained his 
backing. And such backing was the crucial element in the struggle. Thus, the 
sparring and accommodation was a product of particular circumstances and not of 
the factional conflict itself.112 
       A shift in the balance of power in Beijing had immediate repercussions in 
the provinces. In Zhejiang, Tan and Tie could call on the backing of the Nanjing 
Military Region Commander, Xu Shiyou, and Zhou Enlai. Tan and Tie's principal 
opponents Zhang Yongsheng, Weng Senhe and He Xianchun had established ties 
with Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao and Wang Hongwen. Within the province Tan 
and Tie could count on the loyalty of Xia Qi and other leaders of the ZPMD, 
rehabilitated cadres, veteran trade union leaders, older and more skilled workers 
 and the support of former Red Storm militants. Zhang, Weng, and He's support 
base was strongest amongst young factory workers and ex-college students in 
 Hangzhou, who had formed the bulk of United Headquarters membership in the 
 mid 1960s. Additionally they could draw on ties with revolutionary leading cadres 
 such as Lai Keke, Wang Zida and Shen Ce, who had come under suspicion in the 
 campaign against Chen Boda and Lin Biao, and who had previously supported 
 them in 1967. The contest between the two sides was about to be joined and it 
 promised to be a more even and harder fought battle than that of the previous 
 decade, despite appearances to the contrary. 
        A major factor which affected the ability of the CCP ZPC to handle the rebels' 
 challenge was the division within its ranks. The ZPC standing committee 
 consisted of rehabilitees from the Cultural Revolution who had been serving in 
 the province in 1966 (Chen Weida and Chen Bing) or who had been serving 
 elsewhere but had experience in Zhejiang (Tan Qilong). There were 
 "revolutionary leading cadres" who had actively supported the Maoist forces in 
 the Cultural Revolution (Lai Keke, Shen Ce and Wang Zida) and who had served 
 in the province for some time. Additionally, there were PLA representatives loyal 
 to Xu Shiyou (Tie Ying and Xia Qi) on the one hand and those who had been 
 closely involved in the "three supports and two militaries" work from the ground 
 forces of the twentieth army (Zhu Quanlin -- ) and the local garrison 
 (Dai Kelin), the 5th Air Force (Bai Zongshan) and the navy (Xie Zhenghao and 

 Chai Qikun). 
        The possibility of such a heterogeneous group possessing either the capacity 
130       CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEpANG 

or the will to act in unison was slim. A myriad of ties and obligations bound 
 different individuals to patrons in Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing and to former 
 leaders of the two principal mass organizations. Mass organizations had 
 maintained liaison stations in major cities until 1969. Prior to the Cultural 
 Revolution the provincial government of Zhejiang had run offices in both 
 Beijing and Shanghai. While the office in the national capital was not reopened 
 until December 1981, its counterpart in Shanghai was back in operation by 1973.113 
 Presumably, the re-establishment of the Shanghai agency enabled the Zhejiang 
 authorities to keep abreast with developments in the metropolis which was the 
 base of the central radical leadership. Prior warning of initiatives which the 
 radicals would launch in the following few years would be invaluable to the 

 leadership in Zhejiang.

         Provincial Congress of the CCP, May 25,1978, HZRB, June 7,1978. During the first few 
         months of 1972 a conspicuous campaign to "learn from Jiangsu", Xu’s bailiwick, was mounted 
         in Zhejiang. See ZPS, February 5, 1972, FBIS/CH1, 34 (1972), C9-11; ZPS, January 27,1972,

         in his mid to late fifties, not in his sixties as implied by one source, which guessed Tie's age 
         in 1977 to have been sixty-seven. See E.A. Wayne, "The Politics of Restaffing China's 
         Provinces", Contemporary China, 2 (1978), p. 136. A Hong Kong source estimated correctly 
         that in 1979 Tie was "over 60", thereby placing him, in 1972, in his late fifties. Dongxiang

          occurrence in Zhejiang, and elsewhere, that political leaders under attack found it 
          convenient to change their environment by resting and recuperating in the comparative peace 
          and comfort of a hospital. The Zhejiang Hospital, reserved mainly for cadres and foreigners 
          and situated opposite the Botanic Gardens in the tranquil West Lake district of Hangzhou, 
          would have treated many such cases in the decade of the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural 
          Revolution radicals accused Lin Biao of "politicitis". See Liu Lin,

          became popular occasions to announce the return to office of rehabilitated officials. The two 
          Chens old boss, Jiang Hua, was "liberated" in May 1973 by a decision of a central work 
          conference. See Ye Yonglie, Wang Hongwen xingshuailu, p. 390. He reappeared publicly for 
          the first time at the funeral service which was held in Beijing on July 28,1973 for former 
          Deputy-governor of Zhejiang, Feng Baiju. In the following month Jiang was elected an 
          alternate member of the CC at the CCP 10th National Congress.
