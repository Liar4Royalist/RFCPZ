                                  CENTRAL INTERVENTION, 

                                              JULY 1975 


      Reports that problems existed in Hangzhou appeared in the Chinese national 
press in mid-July 1975. A Xinhua release of 13 July surveyed six major factories in 
the city -- the Hangzhou Iron and Steel Mill, the Hangzhou Silk Printing and 
Dyeing Complex, the Hangzhou Oxygen Generator Factory, the Hangzhou No. 1 
Cotton Dyeing and Printing Mill, the Hangzhou No. 2 Cotton Mill (^rC'jt| H 
- and the Zhejiang Hemp Mill and described them as 
important units in the metallurgy, machinery and textile branches. The factories 
turned out producer and consumer items for the national market and also 
supplied foreign customers.1 
       Although the article was packed with the Maoist rhetoric and slogans 
characteristic of the times, it also reflected genuine concerns about lagging 
production. It attributed such difficulties to the "interference of bourgeois 
factionalism", "the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and Lin Biao in splitting the 
revolutionary ranks" and sheeted home the blame on "bad people sabotaging 
stability and unity". The report referred to the need to strengthen unity among 
workers and tighten discipline in the workplace so as to ensure the quantity and 
quality of output. Efforts to revive production were taking place, as the article 
noted, at the height of Hangzhou's oppressive summer.2 Nevertheless, provincial 
and municipal leaders were praised for investigating conditions in the enterprises 
and for listening to opinions and suggestions while toiling alongside the workers. 
Their example had apparently rubbed off on enterprise cadres who had joined the 
workers in shift-work. In hindsight then, the report may be seen as advance 
warning that dramatic events were about to occur in Zhejiang. 
       In fact, at the time that the article was published, a central delegation had 
been in Hangzhou investigating local affairs for about a fortnight. It was not, 
contrary to popular belief, Deng Xiaoping who personally visited Hangzhou in 
July 1975 to solve the problems plaguing the province. It seems that a Hong Kong 
journalist was responsible for promoting this inaccuracy. In one article he 
reported that "Foreign visitors have been told that ... Deng ... personally visited 
Hangzhou to thrash out problems with the municipal authorities".3 Several 
articles claimed that both Deng and Wang Hongwen visited Hangzhou in the 
                                                              CENTRAL INTERVENTION 199 

spring of 1975 to review the situation4 and Leo Goodstadt contended that Wang 
"failed to restore order". A Taiwan publication asserted that both Wang and Deng 
failed in their missions.5 Secondary sources6 have taken the assertions as correct, 
 despite reliable evidence to the contrary which was published soon after the 
 downfall of the Gang of Four.7 The fact that Hangzhou was reportedly declared 
 off-limits to Western journalists at the height of outside interest in its affairs was a 
 mitigating factor which contributed to this mistake by contemporary observers. 
 Taiwan sources claim variously that Hangzhou was closed to all foreign and 
 overseas Chinese tourists from April or May 1975 until the situation was brought 
 under control. Other sources contradict this assertion. One academic observer 
 claimed that "Visitors to China during this period reported that there was little 
 evidence of the disturbances and that travel to the popular scenic spots of 
 Hangzhou was, generally speaking, not interrupted".8 
        It is possible that Deng visited Hangzhou in the spring of 1975 if only to 
 report to Mao, who spent a day or two in the city on his return from several 
 months rest in Changsha. That Deng played a role in the settlement of the 
 problem was admitted by a representative of the provincial leadership to foreign 
 correspondents in January 1977.9 However, Deng did not supervise the leadership 
 changes or personally investigate conditions in Hangzhou's factories in July. 
 Either on 30 June or 1 July 1975 two emissaries of the central leadership arrived in 
 Hangzhou.10 Their brief was to assist the provincial leadership to try and solve the 
 chronic problems which had plagued the administration for well over eighteen 
 months. The two central leaders were Wang Hongwen11 and Ji Dengkui.12 
        The choice of Wang was not surprising as he was responsible for party affairs 
 in East China.13 However, China News Summary also pointed out the ambiguity 
 and awkwardness of Wang's position. As the journal perceptively noted, Wang 

        should have been in a position to provide sympathy and support for 
        the struggle of the radical Leftists in the Chekiang factories. However, 
        his official mission there was to restrain and even suppress them and 
        to compel them to resume work and obey discipline rather than engage 
        in factional struggle. The success of his mission will alienate him from 
        the radical Leftists and the failure of his mission will affect his status as 
        a top Party leader.14 

 It is highly likely that Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping chose Wang for these very 
 reasons. Zhang Yongsheng heard on the grapevine that during a visit to 
 Hangzhou Deng had informed Tan Qilong that he had not come to solve the 
 problem. He left that for those who had caused it (^4? & A)-15 
 As a Chinese informant aptly put it: "Zhou and Deng were very smart for they 
 did not attack the left themselves but got the middle of the road people to attack 

 the left for them".16 
200 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

       It was probably true that Wang continued to command respect among 
younger factory workers and they would probably be more likely to listen to him 
than a representative of the veteran cadres. And presumably, as an upholder of 
law and order, Ji could be expected to share the concern of veteran leaders for the 
breakdown of local authority in Zhejiang. As chapters seven and eight of this 
study have demonstrated, Wang had maintained a close interest in the affairs of 
Zhejiang since his promotion to the central leadership in 1973. However, his 
familiarity with the situation in the province, however superficial, was more than 
offset by his partisanship. Ji Dengkui was held in great esteem by Mao Zedong17 
 and he had no particular ties to the province.18 His relative objectivity would 
 compensate for and balance Wang's open partiality for the "mountain top" 
 faction. The Taiwan journal Issues &/ Studies pointed out that in holding a 
 supporter of the Gang of Four [Weng Senhe] responsible for the trouble, Ji aroused 

 the Gang's ire.19 
       After their arrival in the provincial capital, Wang and Ji immediately 
 embarked on a series of inspection tours of industrial and agricultural units in 
 and around Hangzhou.20 They also consulted the provincial authorities with the 
 view to reorganizing the CCP ZPC, HMC and ZPMD leaderships. Wang and Ji 
 brought with them a large delegation of central officials from three departments: 
 the CC Organization Department which would investigate the procedures 
 followed in the "two crashthroughs"; the Ministry of Light Industry, which was 
 responsible for large textile mills in Hangzhou; and the First Ministry of Machine 
 Building which had jurisdiction over such factories as the gearbox plant and the 
 oxygen generator plant.21 
       While members of the central departments received a certain amount of 
 publicity in the local press, the names of Ji and Wang were never once mentioned. 
 For example, on 6 July 1975, Deputy-secretary of the CCP ZPC, Xie Zhenghao, 
 accompanied a leading member of the Ministry of Light Industry to the silk 
 complex where both men addressed a meeting of workers.22 It is most likely that Ji 
 Dengkui was present. On 8 July ZPC Deputy-secretary Chen Weida addressed a 
 meeting of the employees of the Hangzhou Iron and Steel Mill.23 On 11 July Tie 
 Ying accompanied a "leading member" of the central delegation to the Zhejiang 
 Hemp Mill where, together with Deputy-secretary of the CCP HMC Zhou Feng, 
 they spoke to the assembled employees.24 Despite the secrecy surrounding their 
 activities the city's citizen's were well aware of Wang and Ji's presence. Remarks 
 made by the pair during their stay quickly circulated around the city. During one 
 briefing, Wang was told that Guo Zhisong, a leader of the "mountain base" faction 
 had always adopted the correct position. To this remark Wang allegedly 
 expostulated: "crap!" (,!£ j£). Posters quoting Wang to this effect aroused great 
                                                             CENTRAL INTERVENTION 201 

merriment among the people of Hangzhou. On a more sobering and alarming 
note, during his tours of inspection Ji Dengkui warned the city's residents that if 
production did not return to normal they would be forced to drink the water of 
the West Lake to stay alive.25 
      After more than a fortnight's investigation Wang, and possibly Ji, returned 
to Beijing on 17 July 1975 to report to the Politburo. On that same day the central 
leadership approved a report from the provincial party committee on the subject 
of the reorganization of its standing committee.26 Wang returned to Hangzhou on 
19 July in preparation for the announcement of the leadership shake-up on 22 
July.27 On the same day as Wang’s return, PLA troops started moving into four 
key factories in and around Hangzhou. Two days later, on 24 July, the Central 
Committee and State Council released their joint decision concerning Zhejiang. 
       Three major meetings were in fact held on 22 July.28 The first involved 8,000 
office cadres working under the CCP ZPC, who listened to Tan Qilong and Tie 
Ying as well as "the responsible comrades of the Center" -- a certain reference to 
Wang Hongwen and Ji Dengkui — convey instructions from Beijing. Fifteen 
thousand cadres from offices of the CCP HMC and grass-roots units in Hangzhou 
attended another gathering addressed by their new leaders, Zhang Zishi (jjjj* =f- 
5) and Chen Wenshu )• Jiang Baodi, chairwoman of the ZPTUC 
and a standing committee member of the CCP ZPC, was also present. Both 
meetings discussed three contentious issues; the selection of new party members 
and the promotion of cadres, bourgeois factionalism and the state of the economy. 
Party members and cadres of the ZPMD attended the third important meeting 
which was held on 22 July and heard a speech and directives from their newly- 
appointed Commander and Political Commissar. The assembled troops pledged to 
resolutely "accept the centralized leadership of the Party". 
    On 24 July the central authorities released a document containing a seven- 
point decision regarding the situation in Zhejiang.29 The lengthy preamble made 
reference to an alarming number of activities which threatened orderly rule in the 
province. These included anarchist trends of thinking 
j$|), factional struggles, armed conflicts, interruptions to water and electricity 
supplies, raids on the army units (3tj£U5PA) attacks on public security 
offices looting of state property 
Jf}), murder, arson and poisoning of water supplies, as well as the spread of 
counter-revolutionary propaganda and the incitement of counter-revolutionary 
riots The seven resolutions briefly examined the work of 
provincial leaders, work teams and the PLA, the chronic problem of factionalism 
as engaged in by unnamed organizations, public disorder and the state of the 
provincial economy. Even taking hyperbole into account, the contents of the 
document revealed, as the national and provincial print and electronic media 
202 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

only partially disclosed, the appalling state in which government in Zhejiang had 

fallen. 

1. Leadership Changes 

      The first issue which the central authorities tackled concerned the 
reconstruction of the provincial leadership in Zhejiang. It decided to prune the 
ZPC standing committee by three from sixteen to thirteen members. However, the 
total number of secretaries (including deputy-secretaries) was increased by one 
from six to seven and in particular the number of full secretaries (excluding the 
First Secretary) from one to three (see Table Eleven). The remaining seats on the 
standing committee were reduced from ten to six. Of the original sixteen members 
only six, of whom four were of secretary status, retained their places in the new 
leading body. The rest were either demoted, transferred or dismissed. 
       Despite his failure to have kept factionalism in check. Tan Qilong retained 
the confidence of the central authorities and therefore his post as First Secretary of 
the CCP ZPC. However, point one of the seven point decision of 24 July seemed to 
imply a certain reservation about Tan's leadership: 

       The CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee, the Zhejiang Provincial 
       Revolutionary Committee and the Party Committee of the Zhejiang 
       Provincial Military District headed by Tan Qilong are to carry out the 
       correct line and the instructions of the Party Central. The Party Central 
       has confidence in them. The shortcomings and mistakes which have 
       cropped up in their work can only be corrected through well- 
       intentioned (^^&^J) criticism and assistance.31 

A Taiwan article quoted from the document to support its assertion that "In the 
power struggle in Hangchow, ... Tan scored a triumph over his opponents".32 In a 
similar vein a Hong Kong observer argued that Tan "rather effectively settled 
worker disputes in Hangzhou".33 Perhaps this conclusion was derived from wall 
posters which appeared on the streets of Hangzhou in May 1976 accusing Tan of 
having crushed the city’s militia in July 1975.34 In his passing reference to the 
event, an American analyst has concluded with far greater justification that Tan's 
failure to control the factions in his province could have been viewed 
unfavorably by the moderate leadership which then prevailed in Beijing.35 China 
News Summary correctly pointed to Tan's vacillating leadership style in noting 
that 

       Since Tan is a rehabilitated veteran cadre ... he has been unwilling to 
       take strong measures either against the local Leftists who have close 
       links with their supporters in neighboring Shanghai or the local anti¬ 
       radical elements on whose support he has to depend.36 

       Tan's appearance in Hangzhou on 22 July was one of the last that he made in 
                                                              CENTRAL INTERVENTION                       203 

Zhejiang. Although he continued to hold all his provincial posts, after September 
 1975 Tan never returned to the province as its party leader. He appeared publicly 
 in Beijing on 8 October 1975 and on 15 October at the National Dazhai 
 conference.37 Perhaps illness prevented Tan from actively participating in 
 provincial politics in 1976. Evidence to support this explanation comes from one 
 of Tan's opponents on the ZPC standing committee, Lai Keke. In January 1976, Lai 
 returned to Hangzhou after a period of convalescence in Guangzhou and reported 
 in writing to Wang Hongwen that "because many leaders of the Zhejiang 
 provincial committee are sick I have already started to take up some work".38 On 
 the other hand, an expatriate from Hangzhou recalled that in 1975 

        Wang Hongwen tried to persuade Tan Qilong to split from Zhou Enlai 
        and join forces with the radicals. Jiang Ching [sic] also went to talk to 
        Tan Qilong's wife to get her to persuade her husband to switch sides 
        and link up with Mao. The pressure on Tan was too great so he decided 
        to fake an illness and retired to Shanghai. He did not return to 
        Hangzhou again.39 

        It is true that over the previous two years Tan had managed, with some 
 success, to straddle the fence in the struggle for ascendancy between the Cultural 
 Revolution radicals and the veteran cadres. As China News Summary wrote 
 about Jiangxi first secretary Jiang Weiqing, "This [search for the middle ground] 
 may be typical of the attitude of rehabilitated cadres like Jiang toward the current 
 situation".40 During the campaign against Deng Xiaoping in 1976 Jiang Weiqing 
 may have "decided to play possum for some time"41 but Tan had removed 
 himself from the political scene sometime in the last quarter of 1975, before the 
  commencement of the campaign. The list of provincial leaders who attended 
  Zhou Enlai's funeral on 15 January 1976 provided the sole indication that Tan in 
  fact formally continued to occupy his posts in Zhejiang 42 
        Following his harrowing experience in the 1974 campaign. Tie Ying had been 
  allowed to return to duty in February 1975, possibly as a result of decisions 
  thrashed out at the Beijing conference on Zhejiang held in late 1974. The previous 
  chapter of this study has cited Tie’s strong endorsement of Chen Yonggui’s 
  denunciation of "bourgeois factionalism" in his concluding speech to the April 
  1975 provincial Dazhai conference. In July 1975 Tie retained his posts as deputy to 
  Tan in the CCP ZPC, ZPRC, and party committee of the ZPMD. This was despite 
  the reference to his "problem" (fnjjg) in the central decision of 24 July. Point 

  three of the document read in part: 

        Comrade Tie Ying's problem is one of contradictions among the people 
         and should be solved through the method of unity-criticism-unity.43 

  Thus the center's treatment of Tie in the "decision", far from being severe, as one 
204 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

Taiwan source has suggested,44 was in fact a rebuff to the rebels who had 
attempted to obtain a much harsher verdict. 
      Wayne correctly interpreted Tie Ying's position thus: "In 1975 Tie was 
apparently criticized for his views on how to handle severe factional problems but 
was cleared by the final orders from Peking He added that "Tie represents the 
more order-oriented forces in Zhejiang" compared to Tan Qilong's "hesitancy to 
be heavy-handed with 'leftists' in the early 1970s".48 Previous chapters of this 
work have illustrated the accuracy of Wayne's incisive comments. Certainly, the 
three rebel leaders in Zhejiang believed that they could manipulate Tan more 
readily than military leaders such as Tie Ying and Xia Qi who were prepared, with 
Xu Shiyou’s backing, to confront them head on and, in conjunction with the 
"mountain base" faction, to organize alternative militia units to counter the 
urban militia command. In addition. Tie did not suffer from the same liability as 
Tan in having previously been labelled a "capitalist-roader" at the beginning of 
the Cultural Revolution. Those who had suffered this ignominy were, according 
to one Chinese source, severely constrained, particularly in periods of radical 
upheaval such as 1973-74. They were forced to be "prudent and circumspect" UJ\ 
-'ll'' l3t 'K) ar>d could not afford to let others accuse them of attempting to 
"reverse the verdict".46 
      One of the other two ZPC secretaries was the longest-serving provincial party 
leader remaining in Zhejiang and the other was a newcomer to the province. 
Very early in the Cultural Revolution Lai Keke had thrown in his lot with the 
new order. He had been rewarded with the posts of Vice-chairman of the ZPRC in 
1968 and Deputy-secretary of the CCP ZPC in 1971. Lai had kept a very low profile 
in the 1974 campaign despite his initial enthusiasm for the philosophy of going 
against the tide. In July 1975, most probably at the urging of Wang Hongwen, he 
was promoted from the post of Deputy-secretary to full secretary of the ZPC.47 
      The other new secretary was Zhang Wenbi ), whom the central 
authorities had appointed to the onerous position of Commander of the ZPMD. 
During the Cultural Revolution Zhang had served as Political Commissar of 
main force Unit 6408 which, under its Commander Li Desheng, had been 
stationed in Anhui province. In October 1972 Zhang had been appointed Minister 
of Water Conservancy and Electric Power but was not reappointed to the position 
at the 4th NPC in January 1975. Perhaps the center had by that time already 
marked him down for the highly sensitive and demanding job in Zhejiang. 
Zhang had previous connections with Tan Qilong dating back to the 1940s when 
Tan had served as Political Commissar and party secretary to the communist 
guerrilla forces in eastern Zhejiang. Zhang had served as Director of the political 
department in the same forces.48 

      Two naval cadres, Xie Zhenghao and Chai Qikun, were removed from their 
                                                              CENTRAL INTERVENTION                       205 

posts as deputy-secretaries of the CCP ZPC in July 1975, thus eliminating the 
vestiges of the high-level PLA presence in the provincial leadership which dated 
back to 1967. Both men had become intimately involved in military "support the 
left" work during the Cultural Revolution. Xie had also served as Chairman of 
 the Shaoxing District Revolutionary Committee. He made his final public 
appearance in Hangzhou in early July 1975 and reappeared in December of the 
 same year as Deputy-commander of the East China Fleet. Chai Qikun had held the 
 additional post of Chairman of the Ningbo District Revolutionary Committee. He 
 had played a highly active role in the 1974 campaign and after May 1975 
 disappeared from the political stage altogether. Chai, like Lai Keke, had failed to 
 show solidarity with Tan and Tie’s leadership when it had come under heavy 
 attack late in 1973, but, unlike Lai, Chai had no central leader of the stature of 
 Wang Hongwen to protect or support him. Additionally, both Xie and Chai, as 
 military officials, fell victim to the conscious attempt to civilianize the provincial 
 leadership and return the military to the barracks. This reflected a national trend. 
 By 10 October 1975 the percentage of military cadres among provincial secretaries 
 had fallen from 45% at the beginning of the year to 34%.49 
        To join Chen Weida, Beijing appointed as additional deputy-secretaries two 
 civilian cadres. Military representation on the secretariat was thereby reduced 
 from three out of six to two out of seven.50 The most senior of the three deputy- 
 secretaries was Luo Yi who was transferred from Shanghai where he had 
 been a standing committee member of that city’s revolutionary committee since 
 November 1972.51 In the Cultural Revolution, Zhang Chunqiao, 1st Secretary of 
 the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee, appointed Luo responsible member of 
 Shanghai’s Culture and Education Group (;£$£I).52 Luo had worked on the 
 national executive of the CYL in the 1950s and early 1960s and his promotion to 
 Zhejiang was most probably at the suggestion of Wang Hongwen and Zhang 
 Chunqiao. The most junior of the three secretaries, Chen Zuolin (P&'fcl*), 
 was another newcomer to Zhejiang. Chen was transferred from neighboring 
 Anhui province where he had served as a member of the standing committee of 

  the CCP provincial committee since 1971 53 
        Of the six secretaries of the ZPC (excluding Tan) only Zhang Wenbi and Chen 
 Weida were not appointed to the additional positions of vice-chairmen of ZPRC. 
 Zhang obviously had enough on his plate as Commander of the ZPMD and his 
 omission from a government post was an attempt to keep military interference in 
  the civilian administration to a minimum. The failure to appoint Chen to this 
 position may have reflected a fear on the part of the Beijing radicals that his past 
 experience in the Zhejiang administration could impede their future takeover of 

  the province. 
        Only two other members of the ZPC standing committee survived the July 
206 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

shake-up. They were Chen Bing and Jiang Baodi, the former a veteran cadre and 
the latter a worker-rebel of the Cultural Revolution. The remaining eight 
standing committee members, at least four of whom were military officials, were 
removed from this body. Zhu Quanlin, Chief of Staff of Unit 6409, made his last 
public appearance at the beginning of April 1975 which suggests that he and the 
rest of his unit were transferred from Zhejiang sometime in the first half of 
1975.54 It is most likely that the 20th Army swapped places with the 1st Army in 
Henan province and that Ji Dengkui may have had a hand in this exchange of 
armies. 
      If the transfer of the 20th Army did indeed occur, then a major factor for 
instability in the province had finally departed the scene. Unit 6409 had made too 
many enemies and had become too closely involved in factional politics and the 
provincial administration for too long a time to be trusted as a reliable instrument 
in suppressing factional groups. Still less did it retain any credibility as a neutral 
force when the center decided to move troops into the factories of Hangzhou. An 
article from Taiwan claimed that the 20th Army, together with the 5th Air Force 
and local garrison troops, had secretly supported factional conflict in Zhejiang.55 
This claim was undoubtedly correct. 
      Another military cadre who was dropped from the ZPC standing committee 
was Deputy Political Commissar of the ZPMD, Xia Qi. In 1974 Xia had experienced 
even greater tribulations than Tie Ying, having been suspended from his posts 
and charged with the most serious offences. Although Xia lost his party post in 
July 1975, the CC document’s assessment of him, as with the comments relating to 
Tie Ying, amounted to a partial rehabilitation, particularly in comparison to the 
verdict passed on Xia by the triple plenum special investigation group in August 
1974 (see chapter seven). Point three of the Decision stated that 

       As long as he does not persist in his mistakes or continue along the 
       incorrect line, even Comrade Xia Qi should be helped according to the 
       principles of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones" and 
       "cure the illness to save the patient." In this way we can distinguish 
       right from wrong and unite the comrades so as to achieve solidarity 
      within the Party.56 [my emphasis] 

The dropping of Xia Qi from the ZPC standing committee was in line with the 
policy of civilianization of the provincial leadership. It was also perhaps a gesture 
to the radicals who had pursued him so relentlessly in 1974. However, Xia's 
dismissal was more than balanced by the dismissal of his persecutors, chief 
amongst whom was Shen Ce. 

      Of the four additional members to the standing committee of the CCP ZPC, 
three were outsiders to Zhejiang. The only new appointee who had previously 
worked in the province was Lu Jianguang, who had been Director of the 
                                              CENTRAL INTERVENTION            207 

provincial Public Security Bureau prior to the Cultural Revolution.57 Lu had 
established such a fearsome reputation that the Red Guards had dubbed him Lii 
the king of hell (g jgf T )■ In Deng Xiaoping's eyes, his return to office would 
have been expected to stiffen the resolve of the demoralized public security forces 
and to have placed a certain amount of fear into the hearts of the rebel warriors 
who had attacked him so ferociously in 1968.58 A PLA cadre, Wu Shihong 
       was appointed Political Commissar of the ZPMD in addition to joining 
the ZPC standing committee. It was claimed at the time that the commander of 
the Nanjing Military Region lent Tan two political cadres (a reference to Wu and 
Li Bincheng) "to ensure tight control of his troops".59 In the first place, Li 
Bincheng had been transferred to Hangzhou in June 1974 and secondly, Zhang 
Chunqiao and Ding Sheng, the leaders of the Nanjing Military Region, were 
anything but sympathetic to Tan's position. The second newcomer to the ZPC 
standing committee, Feng Ke ($]£), a small grey-haired civilian cadre aged in 
his sixties, had previously served as a member of the CCP Beijing Municipal 
Committee since 1971.60 
     The third outsider appointed to the standing committee was Zhang Zishi, 
son of Kang Sheng,61 who also replaced Wang Zida as First Secretary of the CCP 
HMC. Wang and his deputy Wang Xing had turned a blind eye to the factionalism 
in the city since the end of 1973. On behalf of the CCP HMC, they had meekly 
 submitted to the extraordinary demands and ultimatums presented by Zhang 
 Yongsheng, Weng Senhe and He Xianchun in 1974 and they had allowed the 
 prestige and authority of the municipal administration to decline to a dangerously 
 low level. Because the central and provincial leaderships judged that both men 
 could no longer play any useful role in Zhejiang, they were transferred out of the 
 province. After their final public appearances in Zhejiang in April 1975, Wang 
 Zida was transferred to the Guangxi Autonomous Region62 and Wang Xing to 
 Sichuan province.63 
      Zhang Zishi’s credentials for such a responsible position would not have 
 impressed Deng Xiaoping. In fact he was the antithesis of the plodding, obedient, 
 hard-working bureaucrat favored by the CCP leadership. Zhang had rebelled in the 
 early stages of the Cultural Revolution. Before then he had been a secondary 
 school principal in the Shandong coastal city of Qingdao. On 9 January 1967 Wang 
 Xiaoyu, then Mayor of Qingdao and one of the first party officials to rebel against 
 his superiors (Wang later became Chairman of the Shandong Provincial 
 Revolutionary Committee), sent Zhang to Beijing to find out from his father what 
 was going on Jfc). Kang Sheng received his son in the Great Hall of the 
 People and told him to inform Wang that he should seize power immediately.64 
 Zhang later became Secretary-general of the CCP Shandong Provincial Committee 
 and a member of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee standing 
 208 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 committee. Zhang therefore had an impeccable background in the eyes of central 
 radical leaders such as Wang Hongwen.

      Zhang Zishi's deputy as Second Secretary of the CCP HMC was Chen 
Wenshu, who was most likely picked out from his post as party secretary of 
Anyang District in Henan province by Ji Dengkui. In total, the CCP HMC 
leadership experienced an even more extensive restructuring than its provincial 
counterpart: of a total number of seven secretaries and deputy-secretaries, only

one or two retained their posts after the July 1975 overhaul (See Table Twelve). 
This startling fact demonstrated the complete lack of confidence which was shown 
by the center in the administration of one of China's major cities. In 1974, the 
leadership of the CCP HMC had consisted of: Wang Zida (1st Secretary), Wang 
Xing (2nd Secretary) and deputy-secretaries Wang Shichuan (Q; ^jEr J11), (also 
1st Vice-chairman of the HMRC and a Cultural Revolution "revolutionary 
leading cadre") Zhou Feng (Deputy-secretary of the pre-Cultural Revolution CCP 
HMC who returned to office in 1970), Xu Shunian (^^j^) (Commander of 
the Hangzhou Garrison), He Xianchun and Qiu Qiang (also Deputy-secretary of 
the pre-Cultural Revolution HMC and like Wang Zida and Wang Shichuan a 
"revolutionary leading cadre").

      Well before July 1975 the central authorities had moved to restructure the 
municipal administration. Apart from Wang Zida and Wang Xing, who were 
transferred out of the province, in April 1975 Wang Shichuan and Xu Shunian 
also lost their posts and disappeared from public view. He Xianchun was severely 
disciplined and Qiu Qiang was sidelined, criticized and did not play an active role 
in municipal politics again until the radical resurgence of 1976. After the arrest of 
the Gang of Four, Qiu was dismissed as their "agent" on the CCP HMC. Thus, of 
the members of the Hangzhou leadership holding office at the beginning of 1975, 
210 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

only Zhou Feng survived the July 1975 shake-up. Prior to the July reshuffle, and 
undoubtedly on the recommendation of the provincial leadership, Beijing had 
appointed as deputy-secretaries Chen Xia J^)/ who returned to the position 
he had previously held in 1966, and Chen Anyu ([$'£■ )/ another veteran 
cadre who had fought in Eastern Zhejiang before 1949. Both Chens took up their 
posts in the first four months of 1975. 
      One observer has speculated that the leadership reshuffle in the province 
had commenced at the end of May, giving as his reason the fact that Hangzhou 
Radio showed signs then of being placed abruptly under new management".65 
Indeed, the BBC monitoring service commented on the strange behavior of the 
provincial service on 30 May 1975 and the station went off the air for most of the 
day from 10 am until 9 pm. During this period only short broadcasts, relaying 
programmes from Beijing, were heard.66 Goodstadt may be correct in stating that 
leadership changes were under way before July but the suspension of radio 
broadcasts from Hangzhou may have occurred for other reasons. At a rally on 
broadcasting work in September 1975, well after the incident and after Goodstadt's 
article had appeared, another explanation for the unusual behavior of the 
provincial radio service was implied. Such pronouncements as "Bourgeois 
factionalism must never be allowed to interfere with broadcasting work" and 
exhortations to all departments to ensure that "broadcasting goes on persistently at 
all times and under all circumstances",67 suggested that radical demagogues may 
have tried, unsuccessfully, to seize control of the station in late May. Thus, rather 
than signalling a change in management, Zhejiang radio's erratic transmissions 
on 30 May may have been a sign of preventative action by the provincial 
authorities to stop control of the station slipping out of their hands. If this was the 
case it represented yet another remarkable incident in a year full of surprising 
developments. 
      The personnel arrangements which were decided upon in July 1975 did not 
represent a decisive victory for Deng. He may have rid Tan of troublesome 
subordinates but some of their replacements, judged by their performance in the 
radical upsurge of 1976, proved little better and in some cases worse. In any case, 
Tan's stint in Zhejiang was shortly to end. There is thus little evidence to support 
the view that the new appointees to the CCP ZPC would alleviate chronic 
dissension within its ranks 68 Tan himself was hopelessly compromised and 
weakened. The influence of the central radicals on the appointment of provincial 
leaders proved greater, in this instance, than has often been recognized. The 
perceptive Hong Kong weekly China News Summary noted at the end of 1975 that 
"The big Chekiang reshuffle in July 1975 ... may well have increased the radical 
influence in the leadership of that province" 69 This view, as events later proved, 
was correct. 
                                                     CENTRAL INTERVENTION                 211 

      As far as it is possible to do so, it is useful to compare the situation in 
Zhejiang with that in other Chinese provinces. Of the twenty-nine provincial first 
party secretaries appointed during the reconstruction of party committees in the 
period from December 1970 until August 1971, only fourteen retained their posts 
by October 1975. All but one of the fifteen who were replaced in the intervening 
period were military cadres but only six of their replacements came from the PLA. 
Thus the balance had shifted strongly against military representatives with a total 
of twelve military and seventeen civilian first secretaries by 1975. Eight of these 
seventeen civilians had been purged at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, 
and of the eight, four had been appointed to their posts in 1975.70 It is evident that 
such provincial appointments as Zhao Ziyang to Sichuan in December 1975, Bai 
Rubing to Shandong, Peng Chong to Jiangsu and Liao Zhigao to Fujian in 
December 1974, reflected the influence of Deng Xiaoping. However, the 
appointments of Song Peizhang to Anhui in June 1975 and Jia Qiyun to Yunnan 
in October 1975 must be seen as further evidence of the radicals' strength in the 
appointments' field. 
      The radical central leaders clearly exercised substantial input into the 
appointments to the reconstituted party leadership in Zhejiang and Hangzhou. 
However, they could not save the three rebel chiefs, Zhang Yongsheng, Weng 
Senhe and He Xianchun from severe punishment. Weng Senhe was arrested and 
detained on 9 July 1975 on the direct orders of Ji Dengkui.71 Many of Weng's 
colleagues at the silk mill were also detained for investigation and forced to write 
confessions detailing Weng's alleged crimes.72 The Zhejiang Workers Political 
School was closed and some of its students arrested 73 Weng's prison notes record 
 that on 9 July he saw Chai Qikun at the ZPRC hostel in Mishi Lane. Presumably, 
Chai informed Weng of his impending fate. Between the time of his arrest and 
January 1976, Weng was subjected to repeated interrogation by two to four-man 
 teams of investigators.74 He was charged with embezzling 7,100 yuan in cash and 
600 kilograms worth of grain coupons between 1970 and July 1975.75 Additionally, 
 at his trial in 1978, Weng was accused of squandering 140,000 yuan worth of state 
funds during his fourteen-month stay at the Trade Union sanatorium on Three 
Terrace Mountain between 1974 and 1975.76 In numerous meetings held to 
 denounce bourgeois factionalism in the months after Weng's arrest, he was not 
criticized by name. But at one meeting in particular, convened by the CCP HMC in 
October 1975, it was made abundantly clear that Weng was the target.77 
      Wang Hongwen found it politically expedient to dissociate himself publicly 
from Weng during his investigations in Hangzhou. Four months later, however, 
when the radical mobilizers had regained the initiative in the seesawing inner- 
party struggle, Wang could express his true feelings about Weng Senhe's arrest. In 
November 1975 Wang was lamenting that "he's been nabbed and we can't do 
212 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

anything about it" (& D- In the radical tide of 
 1976, Wang spoke out openly on Weng's behalf and by mid-year was questioning 
 the authenticity of the evidence which had been compiled against him.78 Zhang 
 Chunqiao also spoke out for Weng. In February 1976 he said to Lai Keke in 
 Beijing: "No matter what Weng Senhe is like now, his past record will stand" 

   #,).79 These remarks encouraged Weng's wife to write to the CCP ZPC, 
 requesting a review of her husband's case.83 No decision was made at that time 
 but in 1976 Zhang Chunqiao allegedly crossed out Weng's name from a March CC 
 document listing political figures who were to be publicly criticized. The reference 
 to Weng had been taken from the record of a talk by Mao in November 1975.81 In 
 the talk Mao had reportedly stated, when referring to the leadership combination 
 of the old, middle-aged and the young, that "the young must be good, not bad 
 people like Weng Senhe W .'F # gll ^ H l£ # 
 WifA)-82 
      Weng's close associate. He Xianchun, fared somewhat better. On August 5 
 the provincial authorities decided to send him to a cadre school in Yin county, 
 Ningbo District and he left two days later.83 Although He had been "sent down" to 
 labor it seems that he spent a considerable portion of his stay in the countryside 
 touring and sightseeing. He had been ordered to join a study class arranged by the 
 CCP HMC party school, which ran a cadre school in the county. Yin county was 
 close to Ningbo and thus enabled He to keep in close touch with developments in 
 Hangzhou.84 By August 1976 he had returned to the provincial capital and 
 appeared at the funeral service held for Mao Zedong on 18 September 1976.85 
 Although he had been disciplined and demoted from Deputy-secretary to standing 
 committee member of the CCP HMC, He had not lost his official posts, further 
 evidence of the incompleteness of the attempt to destroy the careers of factional 
 leaders in July 1975. 
      On the question of factional organizations, the CC and State Council decision 
 of 24 July 1975 differentiated between organizations or individuals merely engaged 
 in factional activities and those organizations which had been formed and 
 manipulated or infiltrated by bad people (if A)- The center 
 ordered the dissolution (jjg|£) of the former type but banned the 
 latter, a much harsher, more final step.86 While dissolution left open the 
 possibility that an organization could regroup, banning it did not. However, the 
 absence of any direct reference to the militia command in the 24 July decision 
 enabled Zhang Yongsheng and He Xianchun to argue, when the political 
 pendulum had swung their way once again in 1976, that Beijing had not explicitly 
 banned their "second armed force" and that therefore they were free to reestablish 
 it.87 
                                                     CENTRAL INTERVENTION                213 

      He Xianchun salvaged his own career but he could not prevent the 
dissolution of the rebels' organizational power base, the municipal workers' 
congress. On the eve of May Day 1975, the workers' congress, in conjunction with 
the ZPTUC, had convened a meeting to discuss political theory.88 Thus, unlike the 
militia command, it had not been dissolved or banned earlier in the year. The 24 
July 1975 decision rectified this oversight and did implicitly ban the congress.89 On 
the day that the crest of the HMWC was to come down. He Xianchun reportedly 
encouraged his young colleagues to look ahead with optimism but by National 
Day 1975, after three months' study in Beijing, they had become very pessimistic 
about the future.90 With both the urban militia command and the worker's 
congress dissolved, and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams temporarily 
disbanded, three factional organizations in Hangzhou had departed the political 
stage, thereby fatally undermining the rebels' organizational base. 
      Zhang Yongsheng, the remaining member of the notorious rebel trio was 
 also sent to the countryside to labor91 and he departed Hangzhou on 9 October 
 1975.92 His new home was well away from Zhejiang, in a county in Hebei 
 province near Tianjin. The party secretary of the brigade was Wang Guofan, a 
 model peasant and a member of the 10th CCP CC.93 Zhang's punishment had 
 originally been more severe but Wang Hongwen had reportedly said to the ZPC 
 leaders in Shanghai: "If Zhang Yongsheng dies down there what will you do?"94 
Wang’s warning caused the provincial leadership to mitigate its sentence and 
 Zhang may well have avoided the extreme rigors of farm life. In January 1976 he 
 was transferred to a hospital in Tianjin, giving substance to Wang Hongwen’s 
 concern about the state of Zhang’s health.95 At a centrally-convened meeting in 
 February 1976 (see chapter ten) Wang Hongwen visited the Zhejiang delegation 
 and rebuked the provincial leadership for its treatment of Zhang. Zhang 
 Chunqiao stated bluntly to either Tan Qilong or Tie Ying: "If you want to topple 
 Zhang Yongsheng, first we must topple you. Then it will be fair". Zhang also 
 made his preferences known by informing the Zhejiang leadership in no 
 uncertain terms that "I support Zhang Yongsheng all the way". 
      Near the end of March 1976 Zhang Yongsheng was summoned to Beijing 
 and lodged in a high-class hostel. Wang Hongwen enjoined him to rest and 
 recuperate from his stint of manual labor so that he would be in a fit state to 
 resume his struggle with the "capitalist-roaders" of Zhejiang. To bolster Zhang s 
 self-esteem Wang declared that Mao had confidence in him. After Zhang 
 complained of persecution from the provincial authorities Wang ordered Tan 
 Qilong, then in Beijing, to come to Zhang's residence to listen to a two-hour tirade 
 from his youthful protagonist. Additionally, on 28 March, Zhang was personally 
 received by Wang Hongwen and then, on 3 April 1976, by Wang, Jiang Qing and 
 Zhang Chunqiao.96 
214 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

     From his haven in Beijing, Zhang tried to exert long-distance control over 
his faction.97 He received a stream of visitors and reports which turned into a two- 
way flow back to Hangzhou. It appears, however, that Zhang’s subordinates were 
experiencing difficulty in maintaining the faction's morale, with consequent 
outbreaks of internal bickering accompanied by yearnings for an end to the 
constant and debilitating struggle. Zhang encouraged his followers by pointing out 
that ebbs in a movement were inevitably superseded by high tides and that victory 
would certainly fall to them one day. Events seemed to vindicate Zhang’s 
prediction. By July 1976 the "two crashthroughs" leading group which Zhang had 
established in 1974 at the Fine Arts College, had been restored. A document 
reversing the decision of 1975 dissolving the group, had also been prepared. From 
the time of his summons to Beijing in March 1976, Zhang hoped to return to 
Zhejiang and only the arrest of the Gang of Four thwarted his aspirations. 
However, even as late as 19 October 1976 Zhang continued to despatch documents 
to Hangzhou and to work for his recall to the province. 

2. The Despatch of Troops into the Factories of Hangzhou 

      Prior to the arrival of the central delegation in July 1975, the provincial and 
municipal authorities had despatched work groups into the factories of 
Hangzhou.98 The move may have been decided on at the December 1974 Beijing 
conference concerning Zhejiang. Point two of the CC and State Council Decision 
of 24 July 1975 specifically endorsed the action of the local authorities in 
despatching the groups and warned against "any class enemies taking advantage 
of shortcomings and mistakes by the work groups (Xf££@.) or work teams 
(X-fcRA.) to weaken party leadership".99 The admission that the work groups 
(teams) had committed errors may have referred to their tendency to support one 
faction against the other, worsening rather than alleviating the situation. Work 
teams had always been prone to taking sides. It was a perennial weakness inherent 
in their role and function. This time the warning may have been directed 
specifically at the local military, which had undoubtedly contributed personnel to 
the work teams. 
      At the meeting convened by the CCP ZPC on 22 July to announce the 
reshuffle of the provincial leadership, it was announced that "comrades from the 
PLA" who had helped in the work of the CCP ZPC and ZPRC in the "three 
supports and two militaries", on the instructions of the CC, had now returned to 
their barracks.100 It is significant that the monitored broadcast of the meeting did 
not mention this crucial fact.101 The surprising usage of the term "three supports 
and two militaries" also belies one specialist's assertion that the phrase had been 
"dropped from the official lexicon" in 1973.102 Small groups of military personnel 
had entered factories in Hangzhou after the breakdown of authority in 1967. They 
                                                     CENTRAL INTERVENTION                 215 

had been ordered to choose sides in factional disputes and had become embroiled 
in factory politics for eight years. Clearly, they had lost all credentials as a neutral 
force, compelling the provincial leadership to withdraw them before the arrival of 
 military units free from local entanglements and favoritism. 
      On 19 July 1975, the same day that Wang Hongwen returned to Hangzhou 
 from Beijing, troops of the PLA moved to occupy four large factories which had 
 been seriously affected by factionalism. Such a momentous decision may have 
 been taken at the CC MAC plenum which had closed on 15 July (see chapter eight) 
 and referred to the Politburo meeting of 17 July. The first four factories to come 
 under military occupation were Weng's silk complex,103 the No. 1 and No. 2 
 cotton mills, and the Zhejiang Hemp Mill.104 Six thousand men of an unnamed 
 PLA unit stationed in Zhejiang (possibly the 1st Army) went by groups into the 
 four mills. The first report concerning military intervention made it clear that 
 factional fighting had disrupted production and damaged plant and premises. It 
 depicted soldiers and their officers performing such jobs as repairing a damaged 
 roof, cooking meals, cutting hair and washing clothes. Medical teams treated 
 workers while propaganda workers relayed central instructions and held study 
 classes for the members of the contending factions.105 
       Reports about the four mills revealed something of the trouble which had 
 plagued them for months. The Hangzhou silk complex reported that the situation 
 there had improved since the beginning of July, the time of the arrival of the two 
 central leaders in Hangzhou.106 Before then, bourgeois factionalism had split the 
 party and workers, and production and social welfare facilities had been adversely 
 affected. The broadcast described damage to the mill's power facilities, the break¬ 
 down of a boiler, shortages of raw materials, an undermanning among nursing 
 staff in the factory's creche and a lack of variety in food prepared in the canteen. 
 Reports of 27 July 1975, commenting on the situation at the hemp mill and the 
 two cotton mills, made no mention of the presence of PLA troops in these 
 factories.107 But the reports alluded to the CC document of 24 July, especially in 
 relation to its focus on cadre policy, party spirit (as against factionalism) and the 
 need to boost production. At the No. 1 cotton mill cadres had made household 
 calls to inform workers of central directives and probably also to cajole them into 
 returning to work. 
       On 22 July 1975, the same day as the CCP ZPC, HMC and ZPMD held 
 meetings of office staff to convey the central directives, Zhang Wenbi led 4,500 
 cadres and troops of the military district into factories in the city, including the 
 Hangzhou Silk Brocade Mill.108 The ZPMD also assigned personnel to help with 
 the summer harvesting and autumn sowing, leaving behind only skeleton staff in 
 the offices of the ZPMD headquarters, the political and logistics departments and 
 the Hangzhou garrison. While the announcement of the despatch of the first 
 216 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

 contingent of 6,000 troops had been held back for two days, this follow-up 
 disclosure was delayed three days. In order to drum up support for the decision 
 among the populace, Zhejiang Daily accompanied the second announcement with 
 an article entitled "Learn from the PLA". The article called on citizens to emulate 
 the PLA 

      in strengthening the sense of organization and discipline, strictly 
      carrying out the three main rules and eight points for attention and 
      obeying orders in every activity. We must follow the PLA in 
      consciously promoting stability and unity.109 

      Points four, six, and seven of the CC Decision of 24 July related directly to the 
 PLA.110 Beijing strongly condemned any "words or deeds" which weakened or 
 sabotaged the relations between the army and government, the army and people 
 or which affected the military's internal unity. The CC decision particularly called 
 on the military to smash any "despicable conspiracy" by the "class enemy" to split 
 its ranks. Together with the public security and militia forces, the army was 
 commanded to suppress any counter-revolutionaries who disrupted production, 
 caused traffic accidents, incited armed struggle, obstructed [political] movements 
               carried out counter-revolutionary propaganda or incited 
 insurrections. The PLA was also ordered to crush all proven murderers, arsonists 
 and water poisoners. Those who resisted would be arrested and punished. If public 
 order in Hangzhou and the rest of Zhejiang had collapsed anywhere near the 
 extent that was suggested in the document, making allowances for a certain 
 amount of exaggeration and rhetorical flourish, the cities of the province would 
 not have been pleasant places in which to reside in 1974-75. Or, as the "Decision" 
 euphemistically phrased it, such disturbances would have disrupted social order 
 and jeopardized the security of state property and people's lives. 
      In the last few days of July 1975 the center committed more troops to the 
 factories of Hangzhou. On 28 July, Air Force units stationed in Zhejiang 
 despatched soldiers to five factories including He Xianchun's old unit, the Heavy 
 Machinery Factory, and the Hangzhou Oxygen Generator Plant where He's 
 subordinate, Xia Genfa, was based.111 It is uncertain whether the units referred to 
 came from the 5th Air Force where Chen Liyun had formerly served as Political 
 Commissar. However, it is worth noting that as late as 1976, Bai Zongshan, 
 Commander of the 5th Air Force, remained in Zhejiang,112 suggesting that his 
unit had also remained in the province. The 5th Air Force had openly sided with 
United Headquarters in its battles with Red Storm during the years 1967-69. In 
 1971-72, because of Chen Liyun's membership of Lin Biao's son's "small fleet", the 
special group appointed by the CCP CC to investigate the affair concluded that the 
5th Air Force had become one of Lin Biao's most loyal military units. Hence, 
because of its past associations and heavy involvement in provincial factional 
                                                     CENTRAL INTERVENTION                 217 

politics, the unit could scarcely qualify as an unbiased force in mediating between 
contending groups of workers in the factories of Hangzhou. 
      The air force units performed such tasks as unloading and carting raw 
 materials, cleaning up the factory grounds and dining halls and holding 
 discussions with the workers. At the oxygen generator plant the soldiers directed 
 their powers of persuasion toward young workers and demobilized PLA soldiers. 
 Veteran workers in turn advised young PLA soldiers. The problems posed to 
 factory management by undisciplined, rowdy young workers and demobilized 
 soldiers were chronic. The case of Xiong Beiping and Xiong Ziping, sons of the 
 former Commander of the ZPMD Xiong Yingtang, is an extreme example. Beiping 
 and his twin brother Ziping, known as the twin Xiongs (]BJ h6) were prosecuted 
 in late 1979 for heading a gang of pack-rapists for four years from 1974 until 1978. 
 Xiong Ziping worked at He Xianchun's heavy machinery plant. Taking advantage 
 of the anarchy and turmoil of these years, and playing on their father's status as a 
 leading cadre, albeit in disgrace, Ziping, then in his mid twenties, aroused great 
 resentment among his fellow workers. The following excerpt from a report of 
 November 1979 described his behavior: 

       Workers in the metal machinery workshop [of the heavy machinery 
       plant] who had seen Xiong Ziping commit all kinds of crimes with 
       their own eyes said that Xiong did as he liked at home and ran wild in 
       the factory. He was late for work every day and knocked off early and 
       only did four things on the job : eat, sleep, behave like a lout and cause 
       sabotage Once a master worker wanted him to drive a vehicle but 
       [Xiong] abused him, saying; "Who do you think you are? Are you game 
       to come here and order me around Pop?!" He started up the vehicle to 
       hoist spare parts and barged about not only damaging lathes, but 
       coming within an ace of causing serious accidents to other workers. 
       Everyone said indignantly at the time: "when rotten old Xiong charges 
       into the melon-patch the melons can say their prayers; when he rushes 
       into the factory it's we who have to look out!"113 

       On 31 July 1975 the Commander of the first division of the 1st Army led his 
 troops into six factories. Five of the six units concerned, the silk complex, the No. 
 1 and No. 2 cotton mills, the hemp mill and the oxygen generator plant had 
 already been occupied by the PLA, an indication of the extent of the difficulties 
 experienced at these units. The sixth factory, the Hangzhou iron and steel mill, 
 was another unit with long-standing, major and difficult 
 problems. The Xinhua report from Hangzhou referred to soldiers performing 
 simple production-oriented tasks such as servicing and repairing machinery, 
 recycling scrap metal, and taking warehouse inventories. The soldiers also showed 
 films, gave theatrical performances and propagated central instructions.114 The 
 report appeared in the People's Daily and was the first mention in that newspaper 
 of the presence of troops in the factories of Hangzhou.115 The report commended 
218 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

two officers (the unit’s Commander Li Guangshan, a national military hero, and a 
Red Army regimental commander Wu Wanwan) for taking part in labor at the 
silk complex and No. 1 cotton mill respectively.118 The article detailed some of the 
activities of the military personnel, who propagated "important directives of 
Chairman Mao and the Party CC" by holding discussions with workers. The 
workers expressed gratitude for these and other acts of kindness. It was later 
admitted by Politburo member and Vice-Premier Li Xiannian that friction was 
also present between military personnel and workers. He reportedly told the 
leader of a visiting Japanese delegation in early September that such "minor 
incidents" were "natural" because they were both "trying to increase production as 
much as possible".117 Whether any deaths occurred as a result of the military 
occupation is unknown. 
     In August 1975, naval units joined the other two services in agricultural and 
industrial assignments.118 The troops of one squad worked in an uncovered 
workshop of the Red Hag Paper Mill in the blistering heat.119 Others cleaned up 
the grounds and helped out in the canteen. The Nanjing Military Region allocated 
seventy-two cadres at and above regimental level to lead several thousand troops 
into Hangzhou's factories, including the iron and steel mill. Soldiers from the 
military region had played a role in regimenting the behavior of students and 
teachers of the city's colleges and schools over the previous six months.120 Point 
seven of the CC Decision of 24 July had directed students not to become involved 
in factional conflicts outside their campuses, nor to interfere in the socialist 
education movement factories and rural 
areas.121 This was one of the few indications that students and teachers had 
become embroiled in the factional struggles centered in Hangzhou’s factories. 
     From the above accounts it is clear that the number of soldiers involved in 
this exercise was large indeed. It is likely that at least 30,000 troops were 
committed, and possibly more. Zweig's hosts at the Hangzhou silk complex told 
him that less than 100 soldiers had entered the mill the previous year.122 During 
my first visit on 12 January 1977 I was told that the number was about 50 to 60. 
Both figures are certainly a gross under-estimation. The first report from 
Hangzhou announcing the intervention of troops in large industrial enterprises 
specifically stated that 6,000 soldiers had occupied four factories, one of which was 
the silk complex.123 Therefore, it is logical to assume that as the mill was one of 
the worst trouble-spots in the city, it received at least its quota (1,500) of the 6, 000 
soldiers. Outside estimates of the total number of troops sent into Hangzhou's 
factories varied from a low of 4,500-6,000 through 10,000 and up to several tens of 
thousands.124 The PLA's main functions seem to have been to stop the fighting, 
provide a safe environment in which workers could resume production, and cater 
to their immediate welfare and leisure requirements. Herein lay the real 
                                                    CENTRAL INTERVENTION                 219 

significance of the military occupation. Unskilled in modern industrial 
techniques, soldiers could not run modern industrial plants but they could 
provide the minimum security conditions for the continuation of normal 
production. This point was made by a leftist Hong Kong observer who claimed, 
not without foundation, that the real mission of the PLA was to suppress 
dissidents and malcontents.125 
      It is uncertain how long the PLA troops remained in the factories, but it is 
likely that they remained until the end of the year. A Xinhua report of late August 
1975 stated that 4,500 soldiers and cadres from the ZPMD continued to work in the 
city's industrial enterprises.126 By mid-October 1975, the military had focused its 
attention on three major internal issues: its subordination to party authority, the 
need to strengthen both its own unity and its relations with the government and 
citizenry, and the resumption of control over the training of the militia.127 In 
September 1975, on the seventeenth anniversary of the establishment of the 
people's militia, Wu Shihong, Political Commissar of the ZPMD, spoke about the 
necessity to "eradicate the influence of bourgeois factionalism in the contingents 
of the people's militia". He emphasized once again the traditional view of the 
militia as a "labour organization as well as a military organization" working for 
the development of the socialist economy.128 

3. The "Eight Factories' Experience" 

      In his talks at various industrial enterprises, Wang Hongwen had continued 
to keep factional cleavages on the boil. At the meeting which was convened at the 
iron and steel mill, Wang asked each participant to state first which faction they 
belonged to before making a speech. When one man declared that he considered 
himself above all else a metallurgical worker and a CCP member, Wang 
thereupon designated him a member of the "mountain base" faction.129 At the 
No. 2 cotton mill a representative spoke of the seriousness of the hooliganism and 
resultant lack of safety on the job. Hearing these words Wang reportedly smiled 
and said: "I've done that; I've also commanded fighting". At the oxygen generator 
plant Wang sought out two factional leaders and told them that "those who got in 
during the ’two crashthroughs' must be kicked out". However, he advised them 
that they should continue to promote young cadres, but in a more subtle way so as 
to avoid blatantly flouting party regulations.130 It is evident from these exchanges 
that Wang was feeling a great deal of discomfiture at alienating his erstwhile 
supporters, and while formally enforcing central directives was simultaneously 
attempting to mollify young cadres who were being forced to stand aside. 
     Wang returned to the silk complex in August 1975.131 During a meeting 
with representatives from the workers he reportedly asked his audience not 
to raise wage demands. Hearing this, a member of the audience stood up and 
220 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

berated Wang thus: 

      Comrade Vice-chairman, aren't you presently on grade 2 of the central 
      [wage] scale? Think back to what grade you were on at the No. 7 textile 
      mill in Shanghai. Was it the 17th or 18th? You rebelled against Chen 
      Pixian and Cao Diqiu [1st Secretary and Mayor respectively of Shanghai 
      at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution] and rose to become party 
      secretary of the municipality. In the last two years you've done even 
      better and risen to grade 2 at the center! But you ask us not to raise the 
      question of wages and promotion in grades. What kind of work style is 
      this? Ok. So we don't raise the issue and all eat from the same pot. 
      What do you think of that?132 

      In supposed contrast to Wang's subjective and provocative approach, Ji 
Dengkui had expressed satisfaction at being informed, on a visit to Shangwang 
brigade, that there were no factions among the brigade's peasants.133 However, in 
reality the brigade party secretary Wang Jinyou was no exception when it came to 
indulging in factionalism and opportunism. In 1977, Wang was lauded as a 
shining example of a cadre who had defied the Gang of Four and its followers in 
Zhejiang. It is true that in January 1976 Wang published an article in the Zhejiang 
Daily in which he castigated slogans prevalent in 1974 such as "don’t work for the 
wrong political line", and accused a "group of swindlers" of "practising 
retrogression under the guise of opposing restoration".134 Unfortunately for 
Wang, he published another article on the very eve of the arrest of the Gang of 
 Four in which he savagely attacked Deng Xiaoping.135 Even more ironically, the 
 phrases that Wang had used in his January 1976 article were taken directly from 
 the same "General Program", which he condemned in no uncertain terms nine 
 months later. 
      From Ji and Wang's investigations of Hangzhou's industrial sector, seven 
 factories were singled out for special attention. Another unit, the Hangzhou 
 Gearbox Works (#t'J1j^j$£3§,T), was hailed as being worthy of emulation. 
 The lessons to be drawn from the positive experience of the gearbox works and 
 the negative experience of the other seven plants were summed up and became 
 known as the "eight factories’ experience" (A'f'I The 
 other seven plants were the silk complex, the oxygen generator plant, the hemp 
 mill, the silk brocade mill, the iron and steel mill, the No. 1 cotton printing and 
 dyeing mill and the No. 2 cotton mill. The provincial leadership widely publicized 
 the example of the eight factories throughout Hangzhou and Zhejiang for the 
remainder of 1975. 
      Apart from the Hangzhou No. 2 Cotton Mill situated in Xiaoshan, I visited 
all the factories -- the brocade mill twice and the silk complex three times - during 
my two and a half years in Hangzhou. I was able to question cadres about events of 
 the previous years and speak to participants such as Zhang Jifa at the iron and 
                                                     CENTRAL INTERVENTION                221 

steel mill and Shen Qiying and Shen Chuyun at the silk complex. Four of the six 
factories which had suffered production losses in the years 1974-76 (the gearbox 
plant being an outstanding exception) provided me with the following figures: 
      *Zhejiang Hemp Mill — production losses of 66 million yuan (1974-76), 
equivalent to the cost of building two mills; 
      "Hangzhou No. 1 Cotton Printing and Dyeing Mill -- production losses of 170 
million yuan and profits foregone of 54 million yuan, equivalent to the cost of 2 
mills; 
      "Hangzhou Iron and Steel Mill — total output for 1974-76 equal to that of 
1973. Per capita output value 1973 was 10,500 yuan while in 1976 it had fallen to 
4,300 yuan. Profit losses for 1974-6 totalled 80 million yuan; 
      "Hangzhou Oxygen Generator Plant -- 1974-76 production losses totalled 67 
million yuan, equal to the cost of building one and a half mills of this size. In 1974 
production dropped 62.7% from 1973, in 1975 it increased 101% over 1974, and in 
1976 it dropped by 46.6%. 
      The People's Daily published a laudatory piece on the Hangzhou Gearbox 
Factory in mid-August 1975.136 Zhejiang Daily had published an editorial in a 
similar vein on 13 July 1975 entitled "Adhere to Party Spirit and Principle -- Learn 
from the Comrades of the Hangzhou Gearbox Works".137 Yet an account 
published in Taiwan listed the Hangzhou Gearbox Works as one of the factories 
worst affected by what it described as strikes.138 The Chinese press made it 
abundantly clear, however, that the factory was an outstanding example of a unit 
which continued to meet its production targets amidst the trouble which 
surrounded it. What distinguished the gearbox plant from the seven other 
factories was that it had met its production targets in the first half of 1975. Since 
1968 the factory had achieved outstanding results, with production increasing at 
an average annual rate of 21%. It had thus become a model unit and an advanced 
enterprise in learning from the nationally famous Daqing oil-field. The People's 
Daily article attributed the factory's success to its determination not to weaken or 
deviate from the leadership of the CCP. Such tendencies had not occurred even in 
the campaign against Lin Biao and Confucius of the previous year. All attempts to 
sow dissension in the ranks of cadres and workers had failed. Although the 
leaders were from different generations they studied and worked together. 
Workers observed discipline, met state targets and actively refuted and exposed 
political fallacies by writing wall posters. Or so it was claimed. 
      The gearbox factory was praised as a unit which had kept factional squabbles 
outside its gates. To learn from this plant meant, in the words of another report, to 
"go all-out to build socialism". Issues which had been raised by the radicals such as 
bourgeois rights were not taken seriously. In words which could have come 
straight from the mouth of Deng Xiaoping, young workers at the gear-box factory 
222 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

were informed that "it is essential to have high political consciousness and a 
sound material foundation in order to do away with bourgeois rights and realize 
communism".139 Other factories and industrial unit were urged to study the 
plant's policy of building a strong, united leading group which saw its main task 
as working for socialism.140 
     The second factory of the eight, the Hangzhou Silk Complex, probably 
provided the litmus test for the success of Deng's assault on bourgeois 
factionalism. By late August 1975 the provincial radio could report minor 
production increases, enhanced unity among the mill's cadres, a certain level of 
harmony among its work force and the unfolding of a campaign to "scathingly 
criticize bourgeois factionalism and all anti-Marxist fallacies".141 Weng Senhe's 
followers had been placed under supervision in study classes and their behavior 
had been repudiated at criticism meetings. Production in August 1975 exceeded 
that of July by 43.29%, and was ahead of the monthly target.142 However, rather 
than reflecting a high output per se, this figure indicated the depths to which 
production had previously sunk. In the first half of 1975 the Hangzhou Silk 
Complex had fulfilled a miserable 18.5% of its yearly plan.143 
     A Xinhua report of the following week attributed the turnaround in 
production to the central decision of 24 July.144 It asserted that workers and cadres 
had come to reject erroneous slogans which had been put forward by "some bad 
individuals" who had claimed that factional contradictions or contradictions 
between new and old cadres had replaced class contradictions and had tried to 
establish their "independence" from the Party. A further Xinhua report of October 
1975 announced that although the mill had overfulfilled its production target in 
September, its employees had continued working even on National Day.145 
     On 30 September, Zhejiang Daily carried a lengthy article concerning the silk 
complex.146 The article mentioned "hauling out bad people" A) 
at the plant and excoriated the evils of bourgeois factionalism. It referred to the 
"self-eduction movement" of "one study, four criticisms and five emphases" 
underway at the mill -- the study of the theory of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat, the criticism of revisionism, capitalism, the concept of bourgeois rights 
and bourgeois factionalism, and the emphasis on the line, the interests of the 
whole, party spirit, unity and discipline. By mentioning both bourgeois 
factionalism and bourgeois rights the article was catering to the priorities of both 
the radicals and the modernizers. The study movement received great emphasis 
in the local press during the following months.147 
     On 4 October 1975 the Zhejiang Daily editorial department invited leading 
cadres of factories in Hangzhou to a meeting to discuss the silk complex's progress. 
The participants enthusiastically praised the mill for its achievements. On 6 
October, the newspaper featured an article calling on all industrial and mining 
                                                     CENTRAL INTERVENTION 223 

enterprises in the province to understand and absorb the reasons for the mill's 
rejuvenation, because the lesson applied equally to them.148 The provincial public 
security bureau, for one, believed that the mill's struggle against bourgeois 
factionalism was relevant to it.149 This was probably due to the fact that Huang 
Yintang, Weng Senhe's close associate and party secretary at the silk complex, had 
also held a position in the public security system. The provincial radio also 
 reported a conference held by provincial departments in charge of silk production 
-- another area where Weng had exercised considerable influence -- at which 
representatives from the silk complex and other enterprises conveyed news of 
 their improved situation.150 
      Another factory which had experienced production difficulties as a result of 
 factional disturbances was the Hangzhou No. 1 Cotton Printing and Dyeing Mill. 
 Sun Baolong, a close supporter of Weng Senhe, was a cadre at the mill. He also 
 held the posts of Deputy-director of the CCP HMC Organization Department and 
 was a member of both the HMRC standing committee and the CCP ZPC. In late 
 July 1975, a Xinhua report about the mill was published on the front page of the 
 People's Daily.'15'1 The article repeated references to the detrimental influence of 
 bourgeois factionalism and mistaken thinking about production schedules. It also 
 mentioned that the workers were participating in voluntary labor and attending 
 study classes, while some had been selected to form a theoretical contingent of 
 over one hundred members. Disunity in this factory was not confined to the ranks 
 of blue-collar workers; administrative staff were also affected. The article cited the 
 case of two leading cadres in the mill’s repair and maintenance section who had 
 previously been at loggerheads. Their failure to get along had resulted in serious 
 repercussions for production in the section. After the military occupation they had 
 allegedly put aside their differences and thrown their energies into a major 
 renovation project. By soliciting the views of workers and encouraging them to 
 make an input into the decision-making process, the party branch of the section 
 was able to solve outstanding problems. It also required cadres to perform the 
 dirtiest tasks such as cleaning machinery. 
       Following the arrival of troops in July 1975, the mill organized a discussion 
 of the CCP constitution and party building principles for its employees.152 
 Production rose in July and August 1975 as the disruptive elements in the mill 
 were disciplined and isolated in study classes.153 In 1979 I was told that over 100 
 men in the mill had joined the militia command in 1974 and had been absent 
 from the shop-floor for over a year. At first they received normal pay but later, 
 after strong resentment was voiced by their work-mates, their pay was stopped.154 
 Production continued to rise into October.155 The No. 2 cotton mill in Xiaoshan 
 also conducted education in the procedure for admitting new members into the 
 CCP.156 
 224 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

      Other factories among the octet joined in the chorus of glad tidings one by 
 one. The oxygen generator plant declared unspecified production increases in 
 August 1975.157 In the "two crashthroughs" at this plant, 90 people were "crash 
 admitted" into the CCP and 120 "crash promoted" as cadres.158 The silk brocade 
 mill, where fifty workers had been rushed into the CCP,159 reported a staggering 
 100% increase in output in the first half of August over the same period of the 
 previous month.160 Workers formerly at loggerheads had made up their 
 differences. Shifts were commencing on time, and young workers remained at 
 their posts for the entire eight-hour shift. Such reports provided valuable insights 
 into the low level of discipline in industrial concerns. According to a young man 
 who joined the industrial workforce in Hangzhou in 1975, the above reports about 
 improvements in work discipline were most probably gross exaggerations and 
 blatant propaganda. He informed me that workers at his unit commenced and 
 knocked off when they pleased and did very little work when they were actually 
 present. The situation did not change appreciably during the campaign to learn 
 from the "eight factories' experience". 
      The situation at the iron and steel mill seemed to take longer to improve. 
 However, by October 1975, superficially amazing production increases of 200% in 
 one month were receiving great publicity.161 The workers of one shift achieved 
 the highest output recorded in the rolling mill since 1966.162 A total of 134 people 
 by-passed normal procedures to join the CCP or gain promotion as cadres. Two 
 hundred and fifty workers [perhaps a conservative figure] joined the urban militia 
 command and continued to receive their pay while absent from work.163 None of 
 the contemporary reports mentioned the eighth factory, the Zhejiang Hemp Mill. 
 Thus, the situation there was unclear. 
      A twenty-nine strong delegation from five of the eight factories - the gearbox 
 factory, silk complex. No. 1 cotton mill, hemp mill and oxygen generator factory -- 
 went to Beijing to report directly to central leaders for the 1975 National Day 
 celebrations. The delegation toured factories in the capital before returning to 
 Hangzhou on 11 October. A rally attended by 100,000 people welcomed them back 
 and it was announced that industrial production for the third quarter of 1975 had 
 increased 9.1% over the previous quarter and 7.3% over the corresponding period 
 in 1974. Output figures for September 1975 were 8.6% above those for August.164 

 Political and Economic Factors behind the Hangzhou Incident 

      The events of 1975 were remarkable even by the standards of the 
extraordinary political upheavals regularly experienced in Maoist China. The 
decision to implement a wholesale transfer and despatch of troops into the 
factories of a major urban center was not one that could have been taken lightly. 
The thorough shake-up of the provincial and municipal administrations reflected 
                                                    CENTRAL INTERVENTION                 225 

the gravity of the situation. Production shortfalls in key industrial plants in 
Hangzhou, caused mainly by drawn-out debilitating factional struggles, had 
become chronic. The reported incident in May 1975 at the provincial broadcasting 
station illustrated the extreme lengths to which opponents of the party authorities 
were prepared to go to attain their goals. 
      Contemporary observers of Chinese affairs in Hong Kong and Taiwan, both 
Chinese and Western alike, were alert to the significance of the situation. Most 
commented on the almost unprecedented intervention of military forces to settle 
industrial disturbances. Above all, this aspect of the matter forced the incident 
into the news headlines and raised questions about the stability of the country. 
Hangzhou, in its troubles, supposedly reflected in extremis, the general malaise of 
a regime beset by leadership disunity and popular unrest. Overall, however, as 
many instants cited above reveal, the literature available on the incident is 
disappointing for its factual inaccuracies, political distortion, over-emphasis on 
wage disputes, and vague generalizations. 
      The New York Times correspondent filed a story regarding the despatch of 
PLA troops into Hangzhou's factories and the replacement of key officials in the 
military and civilian administration.165 He argued that the broadcasts from 
Hangzhou, which openly admitted that there was trouble in the city, were only 
released because of Beijing’s confidence that the situation had been brought under 
control. The use of troops, he wrote, was a warning to other troubled areas that the 
central authorities would not tolerate disorder. 
      Leo Goodstadt, in four consecutive articles published Hong Kong in August 
 and September 1975 drew similar conclusions.166 

      The lesson of Hangzhou [he wrote] was supposed to be that the entire 
      central leadership, with Mao's blessing, had decided to use the city as an 
      example of their common determination to tolerate no use of arms or 
      mobs to seize power locally or to intimidate local leaders.167 

      Goodstadt claimed that the authorities would not have used troops "if 
 genuine differences of opinion about policy or Maoist principles" had caused the 
strife. Instead, he argued, Beijing placed the blame on "individuals whose stars 
had waned since the end of the Cultural Revolution" and who were causing 
 trouble to achieve their "self-serving ambitions".168 He concluded that "the body 
politic itself has weakened" and that factional strife represented real dangers to the 
continuation of the socialist system in China. 
      Other commentators, particularly those in Taiwan predicted, on the basis of 
 the Hangzhou incident, the imminent collapse of the communist regime. 
Goodstadt noted these prophecies and observed that "There is a dangerous 
 temptation to see Hangchow as a massive crisis indicative of a breakdown of law 
and order throughout China".169 He wisely cautioned that "The problems of 
226 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

Hangchow should not be over-dramatised, any more than the problems of other 
Chinese cities which have provided tasty fare for a variety of anti-Chinese 
propaganda sources”.170 
      The question of the relative weight which should be attached to wage and 
other economic grievances in causing the trouble in Zhejiang requires 
clarification. The preface to the 24 July Central Committee and State Council 
Decision had referred to the evil trend of economism (£2'???.£. 
in Zhejiang. Point seven of the document stipulated that unresolved wage 
disputes would be subjected to "further study and consultation".171 As chapter 
eight of this study has demonstrated, during the final years of the Maoist era the 
CCP was loathe to recognize the validity of, or accede to, wage demands. Wage 
grievances certainly cut across and exacerbated factional differences but did not 
create them. Differences on the shop-floor derived primarily from political rather 
than economic factors and the economic grievances stemmed mainly from the 
tensions which had been caused by factional disputes. Nevertheless, the extent to 
which wage demands created unrest in the factories of Hangzhou in 1975 has been 
widely debated. 
      Radio Moscow dted Western reports of wall posters in Hangzhou expressing 
dissatisfaction over the issue.172 Labor unrest over wages, argued Taiwan sources, 
was a major reason for the trouble in Hangzhou. This explanation has also been 
accepted by Western academics.173 If complaints over wages caused or were a 
major factor behind the problems in Hangzhou, it is unclear why trouble on a 
similar scale did not erupt all over China. Why, if gripes about wages and working 
conditions had brought production to a halt in major industrial enterprises, did 
the most severe outbreak of dissatisfaction occur in Hangzhou? What set the city 
apart from other industrial centers in the country and necessitated such drastic 
action by Beijing? Goodstadt suggested a higher percentage of the residents of 
Hangzhou were employed in the industrial sector than in cities such as Beijing or 
Shanghai. Additionally, he speculated that its citizens, with their heterogeneous 
origins, lacked a sense of community and that urban facilities such as housing 
were in short supply.174 Although this argument deserves consideration as an 
interesting foray into the field of urban sociology, Goodstadt's hypotheses appear 
somewhat fanciful. The housing problem in Shanghai was undoubtedly worse 
than in Hangzhou and major inland Chinese cities contained populations of even 
more recent and disparate background. 
      A contemporary monograph on China's political economy, in its passing 
reference to the Hangzhou Incident", dismissed the view that wage disputes 
caused the trouble. It argued that workers' complaints were directed more at the 
inadequacy of collective welfare facilities and the failure of cadres to participate in 
collective labor. The author raised secondary issues such as the heat, harsh 
                                                     CENTRAL INTERVENTION 227 

working conditions, intense production schedules, poor eating facilities, 
unhygienic sanitary conditions and family problems.175 However, the workers of 
Hangzhou were not alone in experiencing harsh working conditions. The Hong 
Kong leftist Jun Xing attributed the incident in Hangzhou to worker discontent 
with frozen wages, forced "voluntary" labor and poor living and working 
conditions. He argued that the workers of Hangzhou were rebelling against 
exploitation by the CCP, against the far more comfortable living conditions 
enjoyed by officials and against the falseness of the extravagant propaganda which 
contrasted so starkly with the reality engulfing and oppressing them. Jun Xing 
argued that the constant unleashing of political campaigns only served to disrupt 
production, resulting in increased pressure on workers to make up for the losses 
in subsequent production drives. The pattern had recurred in the summer of 1975, 
with even radical ideologues such as Yao Wenyuan stressing unity so that China 
could safely navigate the political storm.176 
      An analysis of the events from Taiwan portrayed the incident as the most 
conspicuous example of labor unrest in China.177 The author ascribed the unrest 
to a serious reduction in agricultural and industrial production which he 
attributed both to natural disasters and to political and social causes. He instanced 
the campaign against Lin Biao and Confucius in 1974 as an example of such 
disruption and contended that workers and peasants had responded to economic 
hardship by going out on strike, deliberately "going slow" or by opposing 
requisition policies. The erosion of discipline in the Cultural Revolution had 
enabled workers to free themselves from party control and press their economic 
demands. The CCP was faced with no option but to tighten discipline, reassert its 
leadership and subjugate the rebellious workers. That factional disputes involved 
both political and economic matters was clearly recognized by the idiosyncratic 
Hong Kong weekly China News Analysis in two successive issues published in 
September 1975.178 The journal traced the roots of the Hangzhou incident to the 
disputes of the previous year involving the urban militia. The author of the 
articles also analyzed the affair in the context of strikes and absenteeism among 
China's industrial workers. 
      It is highly likely that higher paid members of the industrial working class 
resented and even resisted any drastic move in 1975 to make the wage system 
more egalitarian, a concern shared by their peers across China. However, 
Hangzhou's troubles stemmed essentially and primarily from political causes. 
Industrial production dropped sharply in the years 1974-76 mainly due to factional 
fighting and the subsequent high rate of absenteeism on the shop-floor.179 The 
suggestion that workers enrolled in the militia demanded wage rises is 
unfounded.180 In fact, militiamen received additional entitlements for their 
duties, a practice strongly objected to by their fellow workers. 
228 CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN ZHEJIANG 

     Industrial unrest was part of the strategy of sabotage and destabilization 
orchestrated from Beijing by Wang Hongwen in particular and implemented in 
Hangzhou by Weng Senhe and his associates. The resultant slump in output 
would reflect badly on the provincial and municipal party leaderships and the 
leaders of factories hostile to the exponents of "bourgeois factionalism", where 
disruption was greatest. Naturally, workshop conditions deteriorated if machinery 
lay idle or damaged and logistic staff were unable or unwilling to cook meals or 
run creches. Intimidation and threats kept many workers away from their units 
and those who did attend worked in a very insecure environment. Ultimately, 
however, the relative emphasis that is placed on political or economic factors 
reveals more about the perspective of the observer than the incident itself.

2.       The high temperatures in Hangzhou at this time were frequently commented on in provincial 
         reports. July is normally the hottest month in Hangzhou. Its most famous attraction, the 
         West Lake, contributes to the suffocating humidity in that month. The lake is surrounded by 

         hills on three sides and warm moisture rises from its surface and remains suspended over the 

         city. Having lived through the dreadful summer of 1978 when the highest temperature 

          reached a record 39.9C, the author finds it difficult to comprehend the effect of the city's 

          heat on steel workers or textile operatives.

                with a draft "Decision on certain questions concerning the three supports and two militaries" 

                attached. The latter document directed that in areas and units where party committees had 
               been established, such organizations should be disbanded and personnel withdrawn. See

113.         RMRB, 18 November 1979. When local policemen came to detain Xiong Beiping at Qingbo 
             Gate, where the family lived in the military compound of the ZPMD headquarters, Xiong 

             said threateningly to the squad leader; "My father will be back soon. If you run me in, you 
             must reckon on the consequences". Although the national press did not report the case until 

             November 1979, Hangzhou Daily had carried an article on the subject one year earlier, 
             without mentioning names. See HZRB, October 25, 1978. At their trial, Ziping was 
             condemned to death and Beiping receiving a two-year suspended death sentence. Beiping 
              worked at the oxygen generator plant where Xia Genfa was a rebel leader. See also RMRB, 

             November 15 and 16,1979. A mimeographed newssheet from Guangzhou's Zhongshan 

              University Red Star Group (SLiH'SD, dated 15 August 1982, went further than the 
              People's Daily in claiming that the gang rapes had occurred in the lodgings of the Xiong 
              twins, that is in the military barracks. Hangzhou Daily had previously admitted this fact.
